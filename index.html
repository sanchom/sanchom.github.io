People use this data to predict soaring conditions, atmospheric stability, and the likelihood of severe weather. Previous diagrams have been called the most difficult atmospheric diagrams to read. AtmosView helps people to see better the information they’re interested in and allows for easier comparisons between multiple charts.</p><p>Sancho McCann. “Atmospheric Sounding Visualization.” <span>[<a href="assets/McCann-AtmosView.pdf&quot;">project report</a>]</span></p><h4>Humanoid Robot</h4><p><a href="assets/abarenbou.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/abarenbou-225x300.png" width="150"/></a> I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~jacky/">Dr. Jacky Baltes</a> to build a small-size humanoid robot. I coded in C and cross compiled for the ARM processor on a Sony Clie. I programmed it to walk and to find and kick a ball. This was our entry in the 2005 FIRA RoboWorld Cup.</p><p>Sancho McCann and Jacky Baltes. “Abarenbou–A Small Vision-Based Humanoid Robotic Research platform.” In <em>Proc. of the Third International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems (CIRAS)</em>, 2005. <span>[<a href="assets/McCannBaltes-Abarenbou.pdf">pdf</a>]</span></p><h4>Robot Airplane</h4><p><a href="assets/airplane.png"><img class="thumbnail" src="assets/airplane.png" width="150"/></a> At the University of Manitoba, I was part of a team that built a robot airplane that could take-off, fly a search pattern, and land—all autonomously. The airplane sent a video feed and telemetry to a ground station, where one of our teammates could mark targets of interest and report their coordinates. We placed first out of seventeen teams in a competition that included BYU, University of Texas, Cornell, MIT, and UCSD. I wrote much of the computer vision code, which transformed the video feed’s pixel coordinates into GPS coordinates, and presented that information to our ground station’s operator.</p><p>Paul Furgale, Sancho McCann, Jim Majewski, Andrew Bugera, and Kory Zelickson. “Team Manitoba 2006 AUVSI Student Competition Project Description.” <em>AUVSI: 4th Annual Student Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Competition</em>, 2006. <span>[<a href="assets/TeamManitoba2006.pdf">pdf</a>]</span></p></root>
