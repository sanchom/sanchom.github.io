    <p>I am a computer scientist interested in object recognition, machine learning, and applications of deep neural networks. I finished my Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia in April 2014 and was supervised by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/">David Lowe</a>. </p>

    <p><a href="assets/toptens.png"><img src="assets/toptens-150x150.png" alt="Visualization of features" title="Spatially local coding visualization" width="150" height="150" /></a> This method for classifing images takes features that have been extracted from a training dataset and groups them into clusters that are similar in appearance and location.</p>

    <p><a href="assets/abarenbou.png"><img title="abarenbou" src="assets/abarenbou-225x300.png" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a>I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~jacky/">Dr. Jacky Baltes</a> to build a small-size humanoid robot. I coded in C and cross compiled for the ARM processor on a Sony Clie. I programmed it to walk and to find and kick a ball. This was our entry in the 2005 FIRA RoboWorld Cup.</p>

    <h4>Robot Airplane</h4>
    <p><a href="assets/airplane.png"><img title="airplane" src="assets/airplane.png" alt="" width="150" /></a>I was part of a small team that entered an unmanned aerial vehicle competition. We built a robot airplane that could take-off, fly a search pattern, and land&mdash;all autonomously. The airplane sent a video feed and telemetry to a ground station, where one of our teammates could mark targets of interest and report their coordinates. We placed first out of seventeen teams in a field that included BYU, University of Texas, Cornell, MIT, and UCSD. I wrote much of the computer vision code, which transformed the video feed's pixel coordinates into GPS coordinates, and presented that information to our ground station's operator.</p>

    <h4>AtmosView: Visualization Redesign</h4>

People use this data to predict soaring conditions, atmospheric stability, and the likelihood of severe weather. Previous diagrams have been called the most difficult atmospheric diagrams to read. AtmosView helps readers see this information on individual charts, and allows them to more easily compare between multiple charts.</p>

    <h4>Where I've worked</h4>
    <h5>Research Assistant, University of Manitoba — 2005</h5>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I worked with Dr. Jacky Baltes in the Autonomous Agents Laboratory on a small, humanoid robot. I wrote vision algorithms and developed a stable walking gait for the robot.</p>
    <h5>Research and Development, Frantic Films — 2006</h5>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I did production work for <em>Superman Returns</em> and software development for their rendering pipeline.</p>
    <h5>Software Engineer Intern, Google — 2010, 2011</h5>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 2010, I helped develop a prototype Android application with the Geo/Street View team.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In 2011, I worked on improving the automatic organization of YouTube data.</p>
    <h5>Head of Research and Development, Shelfie — 2014-2017</h5>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shelfie was an app that automatically identified books in photos
      that our users took of their bookshelves. We used that information to help people find the next book they might want to read and to give them free
      eBook versions of their paper books. I wrote most of the automatic recognition system, including feature-based nearest-neighbor matching,
      text-recognition, and convolutional neural networks. I created custom validation datasets and tools for quality control 
      pre-release and in production. I managed our SRED and IRAP projects, drafted patent applications, and mentored teammates when they helped with this research.
    </p>
    <h4>Leadership, volunteering, hobbies</h4>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have a Commercial Pilot Licence and a Class 1 Flight Instructor Rating. I got most of my flight experience as a flight instructor at Flying Colors Pilot Training and flew with their precision flight team. I've also delivered flight training to Canadian Forces pilots taking their Primary Flight Training and have held a Class 2 Aerobatic Flight Instructor rating. I won the <a href="http://www.flying-colors.org/WEBSTER-NEWS-RELEASE.html">John C. Webster Memorial Trophy</a>. Today, I stay current by flying recreationally around the lower mainland of British Columbia.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I was a member of the Canadian Forces in the Cadet Instructor Cadre. I helped administer the training of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. My duties included organizing training programs, supervision and development of instructors, administrative work, and many ad-hoc leadership roles. I've developed and taught an introductory level aviation course.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">During my time at UBC, I held several volunteer roles in the Department of Computer Science at UBC. I led activities for TechTrek and GirlSmarts, two outreach programs the department organizes. I was a member of the department's recruiting and admissions committee. I've mentored a junior TA and helped develop and deliver the TA training program. I was the president of the Computer Science Graduate Student Association. I was a councilor representing the computer science graduate students in UBC's Graduate Student Society.</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px;">I played competitive ultimate and held leadership roles with UBC Ultimate, Refinery, and Blackfish. I'm an <a href="http://athletics.ca/wp-content/themes/default-bs3/popups/athlete-rankings.php?id=8218097&year=0">amateur short-distance sprinter</a>.</p>
