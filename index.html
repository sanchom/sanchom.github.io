              <h4>Spatially local coding</h4>
              <p><a href="assets/toptens.png"><img src="assets/toptens-150x150.png" alt="Visualization of features" title="Spatially local coding visualization" width="150" height="150" class="align-left" /></a> The spatial pyramid and its variants have been among the most popular and successful models for object recognition. In these models, local visual features are coded across elements of a visual vocabulary, and then these codes are pooled into histograms at several spatial granularities. We introduce spatially local coding, an alternative way to include spatial information in the image model. Instead of only coding visual appearance and leaving the spatial coherence to be represented by the pooling stage, we include location as part of the coding step. This is a more flexible spatial representation as compared to the fixed grids used in the spatial pyramid models and we can use a simple, whole-image region during the pooling stage. We demonstrate that combining features with multiple levels of spatial locality performs better than using just a single level. Our model performs better than all previous single-feature methods when tested on the Caltech 101 and 256 object recognition datasets.</p>

              <h4>Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor</h4>
              <p><a href="assets/Manifold-e1333591359916.png"><img src="assets/Manifold-e1333591359916-150x150.png" alt="" title="Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor" width="150" height="150" class="align-left" /></a> Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor is an improvement to the NBNN image classification algorithm that increases classification accuracy and improves its ability to scale to large numbers of object classes. The key observation is that only the classes represented in the local neighborhood of a descriptor contribute significantly and reliably to their posterior probability estimates. Instead of maintaining a separate search structure for each class, we merge all of the reference data together into one search structure, allowing quick identification of a descriptor&#8217;s local neighborhood. We show an increase in classification accuracy when we ignore adjustments to the more distant classes and show that the run time grows with the log of the number of classes rather than linearly in the number of classes as did the original. This gives a 100 times speed-up over the original method on the Caltech 256 dataset. We also provide the first head-to-head comparison of NBNN against spatial pyramid methods using a common set of input features. We show that local NBNN outperforms all previous NBNN based methods and the original spatial pyramid model. However, we find that local NBNN, while competitive with, does not beat state-of-the-art spatial pyramid methods that use local soft assignment and max-pooling.</p>

I developed a rule-based behaviour system for finding, approaching, and kicking the ball. The walking gait was manually tuned using custom built software.

              <p><a href="assets/airplane.png"><img class="align-left" title="airplane" src="assets/airplane.png" alt="" width="150" /></a>During my last term at the University of Manitoba, a small group of us assembled to form the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle team. We prepared an entry to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International&#8217;s student competition. The goal was to have our airplane take-off, fly a search pattern, and land, all autonomously. While in the search area, a video feed was fed to an ground-based observing station, where an observer was to mark targets of interest and report their coordinates. Grading was based on accomplishing the mission autonomously, and the accuracy of our coordinates. We found good students, advisors, and sponsors. With a small budget, we needed to stay focused on the goal, and the simple engineering paid off. We placed 1st out of 17 teams in a field that included BYU, University of Texas, Cornell, MIT, and UCSD. I wrote much of the computer vision code, transforming the pixel coordinates to GPS coordinates, and giving that information to the observer in an easy to use interface.</p>

Relationships between temperature, dewpoint, and the lifting of imaginary parcels of air are important to the determination of soaring conditions, atmospheric stability, and likelihood of severe weather. The current diagrams to display these relationships have been described as the most difﬁcult atmospheric diagrams to read. The re-design applies well tested information visualization principles to expose data to the user previously hidden behind lines and frames.&nbsp;This not only improves extraction of data from individual charts, but allows for easier comparison between multiple charts. An informal evaluation of the re-design was encouraging and with some further work, a system designed around the AtmosView visualization should become usable for people with an amateur interest in these meteorological relationships.</p>
