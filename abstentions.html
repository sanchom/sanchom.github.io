<h1>Abstentions at Vancouver City Council: Follow-up</h1><div class="byline">By Sancho McCann · <span class="date">

    <root><p>In this blog post, I share some ad­di­tion­al de­tails about the ab­sten­tions I men­tion in <a href="https://vancouversun.com/opinion/sancho-mccann-when-a-vancouver-city-councillor-abstains-it-is-a-vote-in-favour">my op-ed that ap­peared in the Vancouver Sun on July 21, 2021</a>. In that piece, I ar­gued that “[s]ince an ab­sten­tion is a vote in favour, when a coun­cil­lor can­not in good con­science vote in favour of a mo­tion, they should vote in op­po­si­tion.”</p><p>I also said that “I identified 14 mo­tions heard by this coun­cil that would not have passed had the ab­sten­tions not count­ed in favour.”</p><p>This post pro­vides a slight cor­rec­tion (<b>there were only thir­teen, not four­teen</b>) and shows you the specific mo­tions and their effects. They span the gamut from very mi­nor word­ing changes, to sub­stan­tive amend­ments to mo­tions, giv­ing di­rec­tions to staff on a va­ri­ety of mat­ters, and waiv­ing pre­sen­ta­tions from staff.</p><p>Many of the mo­tions in which an ab­sten­tion made a difference to the vote were mo­tions to amend a high­er-lev­el mo­tion. The word­ing of the amend­ment of­ten (but not al­ways) end­ed up in the ul­ti­mate mo­tion that was car­ried.</p><p>To be clear, the ar­gu­ment in my op-ed would be un­changed even if I dis­cov­ered no mo­tions in which an ab­sten­tion tipped the scales. But it is in­ter­est­ing to see the mo­tions where ab­sten­tions made a difference to the vote. I also hope this might fa­mil­iar­ize peo­ple with the Open Data Portal and Council min­utes.</p><h2 hyphens="none">Correction</h2><p>First though: the cor­rec­tion. The <a href="https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&amp;refine.vote_number=4072&amp;sort=vote_detail_id">Open Data Portal re­port­ed that vote 4072</a> was a mo­tion that car­ried, de­spite hav­ing more votes in op­po­si­tion than ex­plic­it­ly in favour. My pre­vi­ous­ly analy­sis count­ed this as a mo­tion in which the ab­sten­tion made a difference to the vote.</p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/odp-vote-4072.png"/></p><figcaption>The data from the Open Data Portal for vote 4072.</figcaption></figure><p>However, the <a href="https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf">min­utes for that vote</a> (see p. 12) clear­ly show this to be a mo­tion that lost.

As best as I can tell, it was added to the <em>Municipal Act</em> in 1957 and to the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> in 1993. Variants of the rule have also been part of Vancouver’s Procedure By-law since 1887.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-1-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">While I don’t promise that what follows shows the absolute earliest uses of this rule, I want to share the earliest appearances that I have been able to find of this rule in the <em>Municipal Act</em> (generally does not apply to Vancouver) and <em>Vancouver Charter</em> (applies only in Vancouver), as well as in Vancouver’s own Procedure By-laws. The <em>Municipal Act</em> evolved into today’s <em>Local Government Act</em> and the <em>Community Charter</em>.</label></span></span></p><p>The ear­li­est provin­cial leg­is­la­tion in which I have been able to lo­cate this rule is Section 164 of the 1957 <em>Municipal Act</em>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-2-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="abstentions.html.pm-MA 1957" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal="."><em><a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/hstats/hstats/2118119044">Municipal Act</a></em>, SBC 1957, c 42<span data-short-form-placeholder="abstentions.html.pm-MA 1957"></span>.</span> I have tried to rule out the possibility that it was around before 1957. I looked at the text of the 1948 <em>Municipal Clauses Act</em>. It was a revision/consolidation of many of the clauses applying to the workings of municipalities. It contained a clause that is much the same as the eventual 164(1) in the 1957 Act but did not contain anything like 164(2). I then examined all amendments to the <em>Municipal Clauses Act</em> between 1948 and 1957 and could not find that the abstention rule was introduced prior to 1957. I have not done the work necessary to be sure that the abstention rule was not part of some other Act that I just haven’t thought to look in.</label></span></span></p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/sbc-1957-c-42-municipality-act-s-164.png"/></p><figcaption>Section 164 of the 1957 <em>Municipal Act</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The ab­sten­tion rule was not added to the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> then. The rule has lived on in var­i­ous places in the <em>Municipal Act</em> (and now in the <em>Local Government Act</em> and <em>Community Charter</em>) since 1957.

One of those amend­ments was the in­tro­duc­tion of the ab­sten­tion rule.</p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/sbc-1993-c-54-s-62-adding-todays-145-1(3).png"/></p><figcaption>The ad­di­tion of to­day’s 145.1(3) of the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> as part of the <em>Local Elections Reform Act</em> in 1993.</figcaption></figure><p>When this bill went through the leg­is­la­ture, the dis­cus­sion cen­tered on the elec­toral as­pects of the bill. The bill’s spon­sor, Robin Blencoe, said that the bill was a prod­uct of “<a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/35th-parliament/2nd-session/19930614pm-Hansard-v11n3">ma­jor con­sul­ta­tion with lo­cal gov­ern­ment and con­cerned cit­i­zens</a>.”</p><p><a href="https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/35th-parliament/2nd-session/19930728pm-Hansard-v12n21">In com­mit­tee</a>, when dis­cussing the sec­tion of the bill (sec­tion 62) that in­tro­duced the ab­sten­tion rule, mem­bers were fo­cused on oth­er as­pects of that sec­tion (e.g. quo­rum, abil­i­ty to in­crease coun­cil size, the ward sys­tem) and did not men­tion any­thing about the ab­sten­tion rule. Reading be­tween the lines of that dis­cus­sion, and giv­en that the rule would repli­cate what was al­ready part of Vancouver’s Procedure By-laws at the time, it seems Vancouver was con­sult­ed close­ly on the con­tent of the amend­ments.</p><p>I con­sid­ered the pos­si­bil­i­ty that the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> in­cor­po­rat­ed by ref­er­ence the rule from the <em>Municipal Act</em>. But the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> has been very se­lec­tive about which por­tions of the <em>Municipal Act</em> it in­cor­po­rates by ref­er­ence and as far as I can tell, did not in­cor­po­rate the ab­sten­tion rule by ref­er­ence.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-4-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">See <span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="abstentions.html.pm-VC1953" data-citation-pinpoint="s 578" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=" "><em>Vancouver Charter</em>, SBC 1953, c 55, s 578<span data-short-form-placeholder="abstentions.html.pm-VC1953"></span></span> (<a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/hstats/hstats/1675741326">as consolidated for convenience in 1979</a>).

In Manitoba, I can­not find any rule gov­ern­ing this sce­nario in provin­cial leg­is­la­tion or the Winnipeg Procedure By-law. In Ontario, non-votes are deemed neg­a­tive votes. In Quebec, every coun­cil­lor is “bound to vote, un­der penal­ty of a fine of $10.” In Nova Scotia, fail­ure or re­fusal to vote is deemed a neg­a­tive vote. In Prince Edward Island, fail­ure or re­fusal to vote is deemed a vote in favour. In New Brunswick, there is no provin­cial leg­isla­tive di­rec­tion, but Fredericton and St. John Procedure By-laws both deem non-votes to be affirmative votes. In Newfoundland and Labrador, ab­sten­tions are pro­hib­it­ed un­less per­mit­ted by ma­jor­i­ty vote of the oth­er coun­cil­lors.</p><p>Almost uni­ver­sal­ly, in mu­nic­i­pal coun­cils in Canada, it is not pos­si­ble to avoid cast­ing a vote in one di­rec­tion or the oth­er (oth­er than when in a conflict of in­ter­est).</p><p>In sum­ma­ry, this rule has been pre­scribed by provin­cial leg­is­la­tion for at least twen­ty-eight years in Vancouver and six­ty-four years in British Columbia. And as a Procedure By-law, it has ex­ist­ed in var­i­ous forms since Vancouver’s first Procedure By-law in 1887 (first, mere­ly man­dat­ing that each coun­cil­lor vote; then, deem­ing non-votes to be neg­a­tive votes; then, deem­ing non-votes to be affirmative votes).</p><div class="endnotes print-only"><p><h2 hyphens="none">Notes</h2></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-1">1. <a href="#fn-source-1" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a>While I don’t promise that what fol­lows shows the ab­solute ear­li­est uses of this rule, I want to share the ear­li­est ap­pear­an­ces that I have been able to find of this rule in the <em>Municipal Act</em> (gen­er­al­ly does not ap­ply to Vancouver) and <em>Vancouver Charter</em> (ap­plies only in Vancouver), as well as in Vancouver’s own Procedure By-laws.
