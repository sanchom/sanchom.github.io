◊define-meta[snippet]{A correction, and some additional details about abstentions, history, and context.}

In this blog post, I share some additional details about the
abstentions I mention in [my op-ed that appeared in the Vancouver Sun
on July 21,
2021](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/sancho-mccann-when-a-vancouver-city-councillor-abstains-it-is-a-vote-in-favour). In
that piece, I argued that "[s]ince an abstention is a vote in favour,
when a councillor cannot in good conscience vote in favour of a
motion, they should vote in opposition."

I also said that "I identified 14 motions heard by this council that
would not have passed had the abstentions not counted in favour."

This post provides a slight correction (◊b{there were only thirteen,
not fourteen}) and shows you the specific motions and their
effects. They span the gamut from very minor wording changes, to
substantive amendments to motions, giving directions to staff on a
variety of matters, and waiving presentations from staff.

Many of the motions in which an abstention made a difference to the
vote were motions to amend a higher-level motion. The wording of the
amendment often (but not always) ended up in the ultimate motion that
was carried.

To be clear, the argument in my op-ed would be unchanged even if I
discovered no motions in which an abstention tipped the scales. But it
is interesting to see the motions where abstentions made a difference
to the vote. I also hope this might familiarize people with the Open
Data Portal and Council minutes.

◊heading{Correction}

First though: the correction. The [Open Data Portal reported that vote
4072](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4072&sort=vote_detail_id)
was a motion that carried, despite having more votes in opposition
than explicitly in favour. My previously analysis counted this as a
motion in which the abstention made a difference to the vote.

◊fig[#:src "assets/odp-vote-4072.png"]{The data from the Open Data Portal for vote 4072.}

However, the [minutes for that
vote](https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf)
(see p. 12) clearly show this to be a motion that lost. The abstention
did not make a difference.

◊fig[#:src "assets/minutes-vote-4072.png"]{The minutes for vote 4072.}

I have sent an email to the Open Data Portal maintainers and they are
in the process of correcting the entry.

◊heading{The thirteen motions}

Here, I link to and describe the thirteen motions in which an
abstention made a difference to the outcome of a vote. Again, this is
just for interest and completeness.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4096&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4096}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to an emergency interim zoning policy for Broadway
Corridor to UBC. Vote 4096 was on a motion to amend. It changed the
text of the ultimate motion. Instead of directing "staff to extend the
Broadway Plan interim rezoning policy," the motion changed the wording
to direct staff to "explore the implications of extending" it. This
wording made it into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4112&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4112}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the same emergency interim zoning policy just
discussed. Vote 4112 was on another motion to amend. It added some
text to the ultimate motion that directed staff to "consider
Affordable Home Ownership specifically in partnerships with BC Housing
Affordable Home Ownership program...". This wording made it into the
ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4430&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4430}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190515/documents/pspc20190515min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the False Creek to Fraser River Blueways. Vote 4430
was on a motion to amend. It changed the wording that asked the Park
Board to vote. The wording made it into the ultimate motion that
carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4433&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4433}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190515/documents/pspc20190515min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the same False Creek to Fraser River Blueways motion
just discussed. Vote 4433 was on a motion to amend. It changed the
wording that asked the Park Board to vote. The wording made it into
the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5035&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5035}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20191023/documents/pspc20191023min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This was a motion at the Standing Committee of Council on Policy and
Strategic Priorities. They were recommending changes to the Procedure
By-law. Vote 5035 was a vote on a motion to set the time limit for
"representative speakers" to five minutes. This limit made into the
wording that would ultimately carry and be recommended to council.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5642&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5642}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200310/documents/regu20200310min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion on supporting gender equity and diversity in
Vancouver City Council. Vote 5642 was a motion to amend. It changed
the wording to "support the volunteer reporting of" diversity. But
this was undone in vote 5645 because it didn't fit gramatically or
logically with the rest of the motion's text.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5790&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5790}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200428/documents/regu20200428min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion about COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Vote 5790
was a motion to amend. It added direction to staff to "consider
specific pay parking exemptions for essential and health care
workers...". This wording made it into the ultimate motion that
carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5904&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5904}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200526/documents/regu20200526min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion following a presentation from staff on
COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Vote 5904 was a motion to amend. It added
direction to staff to "develop a decision making framework for
prioritizing operating budget reductions...". This wording made it
into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6068&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6068}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200610/documents/cfsc20200610min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

Vote 6068 was on a referral motion. It referred the motion entitled
"Short Term Landlords --- Long Term Protections for Renters and
Hotels" (which was about AirBNB-type accomodations) to staff.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6520&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6520}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20201020/documents/regu20201020min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to scheduling. Vote 6520 was a motion to amend. It added
wording to direct staff to not schedule public hearings in 2021
earlier than 6pm, Mondays through Thursday and that public hearings
should be evenly distributed month to month. This wording made it into
the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6852&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6852}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210119/documents/phea20210119min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a staff presentation about a rezoning. Vote 6852 was
on a motion to waive the staff presentation. It carried, but was
immediately reconsidered in vote 6854 and lost that time, the
abstainers from vote 6852 having switched their votes to votes in
opposition. The staff presentation was heard.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6883&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6883}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210119/documents/regu20210119min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a rezoning application. Vote 6883 was on a motion to
amend an amendment. It changed the amendment to try to add wording to
request a legal opinion about the language used in some zoning
guidelines. Vote 6883 carried and thus successfully amended the
amendment. But the amendment itself lost and so this wording did not
end up into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=7435&sort=vote_detail_id"]{7435}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210623/documents/pspc20210623min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to electric kick-scooters. Vote 7435 was on a motion to
amend. It added some wording to exclude the application of a part of a
by-law. This amendment carried, but was immediately reconsidered and
then ruled out of order because it was too similar to something
proposed within the previous 365 days. So, the wording associated with
vote 7435 did not end up in the ultimate motion that carried.

◊heading{History and context of the abstention rule [◊a[#:id "history" #:href "#history"]{direct link}]}

I'm also interested in understanding the history and context of the
abstention rule. As best as I can tell, it was added to the
◊em{Municipal Act} in 1957 and to the ◊em{Vancouver Charter} in
1993.◊note{While I don't promise that what follows shows the absolute
earliest use of this rule, I want to share the earliest appearances
that I have been able to find of this rule in both the ◊em{Municipal
Act}◊note{The ◊em{Municipal Act} evolved into today's ◊em{Local
Government Act} and the ◊em{Community Charter}.} (generally does not
apply to Vancouver) and the ◊em{Vancouver Charter} (applies only in
Vancouver).}

◊declare-work[#:id "MA 1957" #:type "statute" #:title "Municipal
Act" #:volume "SBC" #:year "1957" #:chapter "42"]

The earliest I have been able to place this rule is Section 164 of the
1957 ◊em{Municipal Act}.◊note{◊cite["MA 1957"] I have tried to rule
out the possibility that it was around before 1957. I looked at the
text of the 1948 ◊em{Municipal Clauses Act}. It was a
revision/consolidation of many of the clauses applying to the workings
of municipalities. It contained a clause that is much the same as the
eventual 164(1) in the 1957 Act but did not contain anything like
164(2). I then examined all amendments to the ◊em{Municipal Clauses
Act} between 1948 and 1957 and could not find that the abstention rule
was introduced prior to 1957. I have not done the work necessary to be
sure that the abstention rule was not part of some other Act that I
just haven't thought to look in.}

◊declare-work[#:id "LERA" #:title "Local Elections Reform Act" #:type
"statute" #:volume "SBC" #:year "1993" #:chapter "54"]

The abstention rule was not added to the ◊em{Vancouver Charter}
then. The rule has lived on in various places in the ◊em{Municipal
Act} (and now in the ◊em{Local Government Act} and ◊em{Community
Charter}) since 1957. But its first appearance in the ◊em{Vancouver
Charter} seems to be in 1993, through the ◊em{Local Elections Reform
Act}.◊note-cite["LERA" #:pinpoint "s 62"] The Act was largely focused
on updating procedures for municipal elections, but it also happened
to make some general amendments to the ◊em{Vancouver Charter}. One of
those amendments was the introduction of the abstention rule.

◊fig[#:src "assets/sbc-1993-c-54-s-62-adding-todays-145-1(3).png"]{The
addition of today's 145.1(3) of the ◊em{Vancouver Charter} as part of
the ◊em{Local Elections Reform Act} in 1993.}

◊declare-work[#:id "VC1953" #:type "statute" #:title "Vancouver
Charter" #:volume "SBC" #:year "1953" #:chapter "55"]

When this bill went through the legislature, the discussion was
largely focused on the electoral aspects of the bill. The bill's
sponsor, Robin Blencoe, said that the bill was a product of "[major
consultation with local government and concerned
citizens](https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/35th-parliament/2nd-session/19930614pm-Hansard-v11n3)."

[In
committee](https://www.leg.bc.ca/documents-data/debate-transcripts/35th-parliament/2nd-session/19930728pm-Hansard-v12n21),
when discussing the section of the bill (section 62) that introduced
the abstention rule, members were focused on other aspects of that
section (e.g. quorum, ability to increase council size, the ward
system) and did not mention anything about the abstention
rule. Reading between the lines of that discussion, it seems Vancouver
was consulted closely on the content of the amendments which implies
that the addition of the abstention rule was not just imposed on
Vancouver by the province.

It is of course possible that this rule was part of Vancouver's
procedure by-law prior to 1993. I have not been able to get a hold of
historic versions of the procedure by-law to rule that out. Another
possibility is that the ◊em{Vancouver Charter} incorporated by
reference the rule from the ◊em{Municipal Act}. But the ◊em{Vancouver
Charter} has been very selective about which portions of the
◊em{Municipal Act} it incorporates by reference and as far as I can
tell, did not incorporate the abstention rule by reference.◊note{See
◊cite["VC1953" #:pinpoint "s 578" #:terminal " (as consolidated for
convenience in 1979)."] It listed several specific sections of the
◊em{Municipal Act} that applied to Vancouver and said those and only
those sections of the ◊em{Municipal Act} applied to Vancouver. The
abstention rule was not one of those sections.}

For a comparative look across the border, Washington publishes a
◊em{[Mayor & Councilmember
Handbook](https://mrsc.org/getmedia/034f13b6-7ec2-4594-b60b-efaf61dd7d10/Mayor-And-Councilmember-Handbook.pdf.aspx?ext=.pdf)}.◊note-cite["WA"]
In Washington, state law does not specify how each municipality must
treat abstentions. It is open to each municipality in Washington to
decide how to treat abstentions. The handbook gives example text for a
rule that municipalities can use to treat abstentions as affirmative
votes. It also provides one possible justification for such a rule:
"If a city does not have a rule, abstentions by one or more
councilmembers may make it impossible for final action to be taken on
a matter, particularly where a majority vote of the full council is
needed."◊note-cite["WA" #:pinpoint "43"]

◊declare-work[#:id "AB" #:type "statute" #:title "Municipal Government
Act" #:volume "RSA" #:chapter "M-26" #:year "2000" #:url
"https://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/m26.pdf"]

In Alberta, the rule is that "[a] councillor attending a council
meeting must vote on a matter put to a vote at the meeting unless the
councillor is required or permitted to abstain from voting under this
or any other enactment."◊note-cite["AB" #:pinpoint "183"] A councillor
in Alberta is ◊em{required} to abstain when they have a conflict of
interest◊note{◊cite["AB" #:pinpoint "s 172"] British Columbia makes a
clearer distinction in terminology and does not lump abstentions
together with declarations of conflict.} or when they are absent for
the entire public hearing on a matter.◊note-cite["AB" #:pinpoint "s
184"] A councillor ◊em{is permitted} to abstain if they were absent
from a portion of a public hearing on a matter.◊note-cite["AB"
#:pinpoint "s 184"] If a councillor does not vote on a matter when
they are neither required nor permitted to abstain, that disqualifies
the councillor from council altogether.◊note{◊see["AB" #:pinpoint "s
174(f)" #:terminal ": "] "A councillor is disqualified from council if... the
councillor does not vote on a matter at a council meeting at which the
councillor is present, unless the councillor is required or is
permitted to abstain from voting under this or any other enactment.}
That's much harsher than the rule in BC. In BC, abstentions are
◊em{deemed} affirmative votes. In AB, abstaining when you are required
to vote gets you kicked off council!

In any case, this rule goes back at least twenty-eight years in
Vancouver and sixty-four years in British Columbia. I would very much
appreciate pointers to even earlier appearances of this rule, its use
in procedure by-laws prior to being required by provincial statute, or
any information about the context in which it was introduced.
