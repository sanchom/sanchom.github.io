◊define-meta[snippet]{Some additional details about motions in which an abstention tipped the vote}

In this blog post, I share some additional details about the
abstentions I mention in [my op-ed that appeared in the Vancouver Sun
on July 21,
2021](https://vancouversun.com/opinion/sancho-mccann-when-a-vancouver-city-councillor-abstains-it-is-a-vote-in-favour). In
that piece, I argued that "[s]ince an abstention is a vote in favour,
when a councillor cannot in good conscience vote in favour of a
motion, they should vote in opposition."

I also said that "I identified 14 motions heard by this council that
would not have passed had the abstentions not counted in favour."

This post provides a slight correction (◊b{there were only thirteen,
not fourteen}) and shows you the specific motions and their
effects. They span the gamut from very minor wording changes, to
substantive amendments to motions, giving directions to staff on a
variety of matters, and waiving presentations from staff.

Many of the motions in which an abstention made a difference to the
vote were motions to amend a higher-level motion. The wording of the
amendment often (but not always) ended up in the ultimate motion that
was carried.

To be clear, the argument in my op-ed would be unchanged even if I
discovered no motions in which an abstention tipped the scales. But it
is interesting to see the motions where abstentions made a difference
to the vote. I also hope this might familiarize people with the Open
Data Portal and Council minutes.

◊heading{Correction}

First though: the correction. The [Open Data Portal reported that vote
4072](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4072&sort=vote_detail_id)
was a motion that carried, despite having more votes in opposition
than explicitly in favour. My previously analysis counted this as a
motion in which the abstention made a difference to the vote.

◊fig[#:src "assets/odp-vote-4072.png"]{The data from the Open Data Portal for vote 4072.}

However, the [minutes for that
vote](https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf)
(see p. 12) clearly show this to be a motion that lost. The abstention
did not make a difference.

I have sent an email to the Open Data Portal maintainers to suggest
correcting the data.

◊heading{The thirteen motions}

Here, I link to and describe the thirteen motions in which an
abstention made a difference to the outcome of a vote. Again, this is
just for interest and completeness.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4096&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4096}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to an emergency interim zoning policy for Broadway
Corridor to UBC. Vote 4096 was on a motion to amend. It changed the
text of the ultimate motion. Instead of directing "staff to extend the
Broadway Plan interim rezoning policy," the motion changed the wording
to direct staff to "explore the implications of extending" it. This
wording made it into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4112&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4112}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190227/documents/pspc20190227min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the same emergency interim zoning policy just
discussed. Vote 4112 was on another motion to amend. It added some
text to the ultimate motion that directed staff to "consider
Affordable Home Ownership specifically in partnerships with BC Housing
Affordable Home Ownership program...". This wording made it into the
ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4430&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4430}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190515/documents/pspc20190515min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the False Creek to Fraser River Blueways. Vote 4430
was on a motion to amend. It changed the wording that asked the Park
Board to vote. The wording made it into the ultimate motion that
carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=4433&sort=vote_detail_id"]{4433}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20190515/documents/pspc20190515min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to the same False Creek to Fraser River Blueways motion
just discussed. Vote 4433 was on a motion to amend. It changed the
wording that asked the Park Board to vote. The wording made it into
the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5035&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5035}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20191023/documents/pspc20191023min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This was a motion at the Standing Committee of Council on Policy and
Strategic Priorities. They were recommending changes to the Procedure
By-law. Vote 5035 was a vote on a motion to set the time limit for
"representative speakers" to five minutes. This limit made into the
wording that would ultimately carry and be recommended to council.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5642&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5642}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200310/documents/regu20200310min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion on supporting gender equity and diversity in
Vancouver City Council. Vote 5642 was a motion to amend. It changed
the wording to "support the volunteer reporting of" diversity. But
this was undone in vote 5645 because it didn't fit gramatically or
logically with the rest of the motion's text.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5790&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5790}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200428/documents/regu20200428min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion about COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Vote 5790
was a motion to amend. It added direction to staff to "consider
specific pay parking exemptions for essential and health care
workers...". This wording made it into the ultimate motion that
carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=5904&sort=vote_detail_id"]{5904}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200526/documents/regu20200526min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a motion following a presentation from staff on
COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Vote 5904 was a motion to amend. It added
direction to staff to "develop a decision making framework for
prioritizing operating budget reductions...". This wording made it
into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6068&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6068}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20200610/documents/cfsc20200610min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

Vote 6068 was on a referral motion. It referred the motion entitled
"Short Term Landlords --- Long Term Protections for Renters and
Hotels" (which was about AirBNB-type accomodations) to staff.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6520&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6520}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20201020/documents/regu20201020min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to scheduling. Vote 6520 was a motion to amend. It added
wording to direct staff to not schedule public hearings in 2021
earlier than 6pm, Mondays through Thursday and that public hearings
should be evenly distributed month to month. This wording made it into
the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6852&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6852}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210119/documents/phea20210119min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a staff presentation about a rezoning. Vote 6852 was
on a motion to waive the staff presentation. It carried, but was
immediately reconsidered in vote 6854 and lost that time, the
abstainers from vote 6852 having switched their votes to votes in
opposition. The staff presentation was heard.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=6883&sort=vote_detail_id"]{6883}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210119/documents/regu20210119min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to a rezoning application. Vote 6883 was on a motion to
amend an amendment. It changed the amendment to try to add wording to
request a legal opinion about the language used in some zoning
guidelines. Vote 6883 carried and thus successfully amended the
amendment. But the amendment itself lost and so this wording did not
end up into the ultimate motion that carried.

◊sub-heading{Vote ◊a[#:href
"https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/council-voting-records/table/?disjunctive.council_member&refine.vote_number=7435&sort=vote_detail_id"]{7435}
(◊a[#:href
"https://council.vancouver.ca/20210623/documents/pspc20210623min.pdf"]{Minutes})}

This related to electric kick-scooters. Vote 7435 was on a motion to
amend. It added some wording to exclude the application of a part of a
by-law. This amendment carried, but was immediately reconsidered and
then ruled out of order because it was too similar to something
proposed within the previous 365 days. So, the wording associated with
vote 7435 did not end up in the ultimate motion that carried.
