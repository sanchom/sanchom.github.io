<h1>Policing Info World: conference review</h1><div class="byline">By Sancho McCann · <span class="date">

    <root><p>On May 23, I at­tend­ed a free, one-day con­fer­ence on data, law en­force­ment, and sur­veil­lance: “Policing Info World”. It was host­ed by the <a href="https://fipa.bc.ca">BC Freedom of Information and Privacy Association</a> (BC FIPA), the <a href="https://bccla.org">BC Civil Liberties Association</a> (BCCLA), and <a href="https://www.kpu.ca">Kwantlen Polytechnic University</a> (KPU).</p><p>There were four pan­els: one on sur­veil­lance, one on pre­dic­tive and al­go­rith­mic polic­ing, one on the ide­al of bias-free polic­ing, and one on search­es for data when cross­ing the bor­der.</p><h3 hyphens="none">On surveillance</h3><p>The pan­el:</p><ul><li>Michelle Davey, Vancouver Police Department’s Superintendent in charge of Investigative Support Services,</li><li>Wade Deisman, Associate Dean of Arts at KPU whose re­search in­ter­ests in­clude polic­ing, law, tech­nol­o­gy, and se­cu­ri­ty, and</li><li>Josh Patterson, Executive Director of the BCCLA.</li></ul><p>On this pan­el, Michelle Davey pre­sent­ed the VPD’s plans for a drone/un­crewed aer­i­al ve­hi­cle. They are still de­vel­op­ing the pol­i­cy that will con­trol its use, but she told us that it will pri­mar­i­ly be used for emer­gency re­sponse and for gath­er­ing data to an­a­lyze an ac­ci­dent or crime that has al­ready hap­pened, es­pe­cial­ly ve­hi­cle col­li­sions. She said that it would be also used dur­ing large pub­lic events to mon­i­tor un­law­ful gath­er­ings of peo­ple (men­tion­ing the 2011 Stanley Cup Riots as an ex­am­ple where this would have been use­ful). Each use of the drone will re­quire high-lev­el ap­proval and they will doc­u­ment and pub­lish each use of the drone.</p><p>Josh Patterson ex­pressed sup­port for most uses of the drone that Davey men­tioned, with the ex­cep­tion of the po­ten­tial­ly in­dis­crim­i­nate wide-area sur­veil­lance at pub­lic events. When peo­ple ex­pect to be sur­veilled, they may be less like­ly to show up at an event they would have oth­er­wise been present for, even when their pres­ence would have been whol­ly peace­ful and law­ful.</p><p>I hope that that VPD’s drone pol­i­cy will dis­close the fac­tors that they will use to de­ter­mine whether a pub­lic event justifies the use of a drone for pre-emp­tive mon­i­tor­ing and what is done with the data in the case that no crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions fol­low from the event.</p><p>The VPD also al­ready op­er­ates a he­li­copter. While the use of a drone may bring cer­tain pri­va­cy is­sues to the fore­front and may sub­ject more peo­ple more fre­quent­ly to sur­veil­lance, it is not different in kind from that which is al­ready pos­si­ble.</p><h3 hyphens="none">On predictive policing</h3><p>The pan­el:</p><ul><li>Ryan Prox, from VPD’s Crime Analytics Advisory &amp; Development unit, and</li><li>Mike Larsen, President of BC FIPA, and a crim­i­nol­o­gy pro­fes­sor at KPU whose re­search in­ter­ests in­clude the se­cu­ri­ty state and ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion.</li></ul><p>Ryan Prox pre­sent­ed how the VPD uses pre­dic­tive polic­ing to in­form where they should place officers. They use pre­dic­tive polic­ing only for the most pat­terned and pre­dictable crime: prop­er­ty offenses. You can see the data that they use as in­put to the sys­tem at <a href="https://geodash.vpd.ca">ge­o­dash.vpd.ca</a>.</p><p>Of course, po­lice pres­ence it­self would in­crease the ob­ser­va­tions of crime in a par­tic­u­lar area, thus po­ten­tial­ly cre­at­ing a feed­back cy­cle where the sys­tem would sug­gest de­ploy­ments to ar­eas where crime had been ob­served by officers, be­cause that’s where they had been de­ployed in the past. To avoid this, the sys­tem does not in­clude prop­er­ty crime that was re­port­ed by an officer; it only bases its pre­dic­tions on prop­er­ty crime that is re­port­ed by the prop­er­ty own­er.</p><p>The sys­tem also isn’t used for pre­dic­tive de­ploy­ments to the down­town east­side or in ar­eas around tem­po­rary mod­u­lar hous­ing. These ar­eas al­ready have their own com­mu­ni­ty-polic­ing pro­grams and officers that are spe­cial­ly trained to work in these ar­eas and with these com­mu­ni­ties.</p><p>There are risks in­her­ent in off-load­ing our de­ci­sion-mak­ing to a math­e­mat­i­cal/al­go­rith­mic process. It seemed like the VPD is aware of this and ap­proach­ing the is­sue thought­ful­ly. Prox point­ed to the Federal Treasury Board’s <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32592">Algorithmic Impact Assessment</a> which, while not legal­ly ap­plic­a­ble out­side of the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment, gives a use­ful frame­work for man­ag­ing the hu­man risks of al­go­rith­mic de­ci­sion-mak­ing in gen­er­al. For ex­am­ple, if an au­to­mat­ed de­ci­sion will “like­ly have very high im­pacts on […] the rights of in­di­vid­u­als or com­mu­ni­ties”, then the gov­ern­ment must (among oth­er things) ob­tain peer re­view by non-gov­ern­ment, pub­lish de­scrip­tions of the sys­tem and train­ing data, re­quire the final de­ci­sion to be made by a hu­man, and con­duct on­go­ing mon­i­tor­ing to de­tect un­in­ten­tion­al out­comes.</p><h3 hyphens="none">On the ideal of bias-free policing</h3><p>The pan­el:</p><ul><li>Dylan Mazur, com­mu­ni­ty law­yer with the BCCLA, and</li><li>Michelle Cameron, for­mer ana­ly­ist and then Senior Investigator with the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, now with UBC as an ad­vi­sor/in­ves­ti­ga­tor for in­ves­ti­ga­tions of sex­u­al mis­con­duct on cam­pus.</li></ul><p>Dylan Mazur dis­cussed street checks and their place on the spec­trum of po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence as a means to dis­or­ga­nize so­cial move­ments. (In June 2018, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs and the BCCLA <a href="https://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/UBCIC-BCCLA-OPCC-Complaint-re-Street-Checks-Jun-14-2018-Approved-1.pdf">filed a com­plaint with the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner</a> re­gard­ing the over-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Indigenous and Black peo­ple in street checks con­duct­ed by the VPD.)</p><p>Michelle Cameron talked about her ex­pe­ri­ence as an an­a­lyst and in­ves­ti­ga­tor and dis­cussed the need for good data in or­der to de­tect ex­pres­sions of bias and mon­i­tor im­prove­ment (or lack there­of).</p><p>The pan­el talked about the difficulty in ob­tain­ing ac­cu­rate race-based data in the con­text of a street check. The cat­e­gories that peo­ple slot them­selves into on a cen­sus don’t match how they might iden­ti­fy them­selves to an officer af­ter an ad­ver­sar­i­al, pow­er-im­bal­anced en­counter.</p><p>This need for data is con­sis­tent with many of the <a href="http://trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf">Calls to Action</a> from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada which call for data on crim­i­nal vic­tim­iza­tion and to “mon­i­tor and eval­u­ate progress” in elim­i­nat­ing over-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Indigenous peo­ple in cus­tody, for ex­am­ple.</p><h3 hyphens="none">On searches for data when crossing the border</h3><p>The pan­el:</p><ul><li>Peter Edelmann, an im­mi­gra­tion law­yer, and</li><li>Meghan McDermott, BCCLA’s pol­i­cy staff coun­sel.</li></ul><p>Peter Edelmann pre­sent­ed the state of the law on data search­es when com­ing into Canada. The pow­er for these search­es comes from cus­toms and im­mi­gra­tion statutes that give the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) height­ened abil­i­ty to search for ma­te­r­i­al that might re­veal cus­toms- or im­mi­gra­tion-re­lat­ed offences.</p><p>It is clear that CBSA re­quires no rea­son­able grounds (as would nor­mal­ly be re­quired for a search) to search your goods at the bor­der.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-1-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act" data-citation-pinpoint="Section 99(1)(a)" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal="."><em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52.6/FullText.html">Customs Act</a></em>, RSC 1985, c 1 (2nd Supp), s 99(1)(a)<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act"></span>.</span></label></span></span> And “goods, for greater cer­tain­ty, in­cludes con­veyances, an­i­mals and any doc­u­ment in any form.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-2-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act"><em>Ibid</em>, s 2(1).</span></label></span></span></p><p>Less clear is how the gov­ern­ment is to treat the data that is on your phone.

Data can cross the bor­der over the in­ter­net and data can cross the bor­der on a cell phone. The data car­ried over the bor­der on a cell phone is mi­nus­cule com­pared to the data cross­ing over the in­ter­net. But the gov­ern­ment treats these two streams very differently. He ar­gued that the gov­ern­ment needs to clar­i­fy with leg­is­la­tion how <em>data</em> should be reg­u­lat­ed and then do that uni­form­ly, pre­dictably, and trans­par­ent­ly, rather than shoe­horn­ing our new elec­tron­ic de­vices into old cat­e­gories of search­es as a way of get­ting at only a tiny frac­tion of data that is cross­ing the bor­der.</p><p>Meghan McDermott pre­sent­ed por­tions of the <a href="https://bccla.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Electronic-Devices-Privacy-Handbook-BCCLA_2018.pdf">Electronic Devices Privacy Handbook: A Guide to Your Rights at the Border</a>, pub­lished by the BCCLA and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC) in 2018.</p><p>The main take­away for me was the lack of trans­paren­cy from the CBSA about their bor­der-search prac­tices, es­pe­cial­ly re­gard­ing the National Targetting Program. What might in­crease the like­li­hood that your elec­tron­ic de­vice is searched at the bor­der? It is im­pos­si­ble to know, but court cas­es and ac­cess-to-in­for­ma­tion re­quests pro­vide some hints. The BCCLA/CIPPIC hand­book identifies a list of po­ten­tial fac­tors, in­clud­ing hav­ing “ani­me and man­ga” or be­ing “a sin­gle man trav­el­ling alone.”</p><h2 hyphens="none">Connection with the history of government searches</h2><p>I’m read­ing a book right now on the his­to­ry of pro­tec­tions against search and seizure in England and the US.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-4-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">William J Cuddihy, <em>The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602–1793</em> (Oxford University Press, 2009)<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy"></span>.</span></label></span></span> A theme that comes up time and time again is how pop­u­lar op­po­si­tion to gov­ern­ment search­es did not crys­tal­lize un­til the prac­tice be­came op­pres­sive to the right group of peo­ple. The law didn’t sud­den­ly give the gov­ern­ment more search pow­ers be­tween 1580 and 1642, but a new op­po­si­tion to gov­ern­ment search­es be­came ap­par­ent dur­ing that time. What changed? Instead of the gov­ern­ment search­ing only the low­er class­es and “va­grants in par­tic­u­lar”, search­es start­ed to be “the fre­quent ex­pe­ri­ence of the many.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-5-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy"><em>Ibid</em> at 94.</span></label></span></span> And the Kings were us­ing these new tac­tics as tools for dis­or­ga­niz­ing so­cial struc­tures and po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion.

Henry VII and his suc­ces­sors want­ed to rid England not only of its hu­man eye­sores but of the “sedi­tions and re­bel­li­ons” that va­grancy bred. <b>Making the hous­es of their sub­jects less se­cure against search­es was the Tudors’ method of mak­ing their throne more se­cure.</b></blockquote><blockquote><p>The rea­sons that Englishmen wait­ed near­ly a cen­tu­ry af­ter the gen­er­al search be­came rou­tine to con­demn it arose from the com­part­men­tal­ized se­quence in which they re­al­ized its im­pact and the so­cial val­ues by which they gauged that im­pact. Although privy search­es were gen­er­al, they aimed at low­ly, il­lit­er­ate beg­gars and va­grants. <b>Articulate Englishmen, there­fore, did not ex­pe­ri­ence those search­es or sym­pa­thize with those who did, es­pe­cial­ly be­cause most privy search­es oc­curred in barns, lodg­ing hous­es, and inns rather than in pri­vate dwellings. Social at­ti­tudes to­ward va­grants as an un­wor­thy un­der­class de­layed re­sent­ment of such search­es un­til oth­er more es­teemed mem­bers of so­ci­ety were sub­ject­ed to them.</b> […]</p><p>Mass protests against the mech­a­nism of search and seizure start­ed in the 1580s be­cause of fur­ther changes in it and in the iden­ti­ty of the types of per­sons that it affected. Having de­mon­strat­ed its efficacy as an an­ti­va­grancy de­vice, the gen­er­al search was an ob­vi­ous can­di­date for ex­ten­sion to the fur­ther pur­pose of crush­ing re­li­gious and po­lit­i­cal dis­sent, and there too, it pro­duced spec­tac­u­lar re­sults against Jesuits and Protestant rad­i­cals alike.</p></blockquote><blockquote>The present-day coun­ter­part [of va­grancy search­es] might be week­ly, noc­tur­nal in­spec­tions of all liquor stores, room­ing hous­es, and video-game par­lors for drunks, drug-ad­dicts, dere­licts, and run­away ado­les­cents.</blockquote><p>(I would add street-checks to this list.)</p><blockquote>The no­bil­i­ty and dis­sent­ing cler­ics, the ar­tic­u­late and ed­u­cat­ed groups most ca­pa­ble of protest­ing vi­o­lent search­es be­gan to ex­pe­ri­ence them rou­tine­ly for the first time in the last two decades of the six­teenth cen­tu­ry.</blockquote><p>It’s im­por­tant to un­der­stand what the law al­lows our gov­ern­ment to do, re­gard­less of whether ac­tu­al prac­tice is cur­rent­ly con­strained by pol­i­cy, prac­ti­cal­i­ty, or dis­cre­tion.</p><div class="endnotes print-only"><p><h2 hyphens="none">Notes</h2></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-1">1. <a href="#fn-source-1" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act" data-citation-pinpoint="Section 99(1)(a)" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal="."><em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-52.6/FullText.html">Customs Act</a></em>, RSC 1985, c 1 (2nd Supp), s 99(1)(a)<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act"></span>.</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-2">2. <a href="#fn-source-2" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Customs Act"><em>Ibid</em>, s 2(1).</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-3">3. <a href="#fn-source-3" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Gibson" data-citation-pinpoint="paras 95--98" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="See e.g." data-citation-terminal=".">See e.g. <em><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcpc/doc/2017/2017bcpc237/2017bcpc237.html">R v Gibson</a></em>, 2017 BCPC 237 at paras 95–98<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Gibson"></span>.</span> <span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Moroz" data-citation-pinpoint="paras 20--21" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="See also" data-citation-terminal=".">See also <em><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2012/2012onsc5642/2012onsc5642.html">R v Moroz</a></em>, 2012 ONSC 5642 at paras 20–21<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Moroz"></span>.</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-4">4. <a href="#fn-source-4" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">William J Cuddihy, <em>The Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602–1793</em> (Oxford University Press, 2009)<span data-short-form-placeholder="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy"></span>.</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-5">5. <a href="#fn-source-5" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy"><em>Ibid</em> at 94.</span></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-6">6. <a href="#fn-source-6" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a><span class="bibliography-entry" data-citation-id="policing-info-world.html.pm-Cuddihy"><em>Ibid</em> at 95–98.</span></p></div></root>
