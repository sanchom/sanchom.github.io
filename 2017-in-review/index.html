    <root><h1>Work</h1><p>Shelfie, the startup I had worked at since 2014, <a href="https://publishingperspectives.com/2017/01/canada-shelfie-bitlit-closing-service/">shut down in January</a>. I took a couple of months off and by the time I was ready to start looking for work, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/9/15235686/kobo-acquired-shelfie-app-readers-discounted-ebooks">Kobo decided to buy our tech and hire us</a>. Kobo’s main office is in Toronto, but we still work from Vancouver.</p><h1>Reading</h1><p>These are some of the things that I enjoyed or that have influenced my thinking in 2017.</p><h2>Books</h2><ul><li><div><div><em><a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/791-hope-in-the-dark">Hope in the Dark</a></em>, Rebecca Solnit (2004)</div><p>Rebecca Solnit wrote this book near the end of George W. Bush’s first term as president. She presents an outlook of hope in the face of uncertainty.</p></div></li><li><div><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/312793/hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-by-carrie-brownstein/9780399184765/">Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl</a></em>, Carrie Brownstein (2015)</div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190696/the-warmth-of-other-suns-by-isabel-wilkerson/9780679763888/">The Warmth of Other Suns</a></em>, Isabel Wilkerson (2010)</div><p>The story of the Great Migration, told through the lives of three people who left the American south to pursue better lives.</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-concept-of-law-9780199644698">The Concept of Law</a></em>, H. L. A. Hart (1961)</div><p>Hart’s concept of law comprises primary rules that tell us what to do and secondary rules of recognition, adjudication, and change. He contrasts this with Austin’s theory that law is just a bunch of orders backed by threats.</p><p>I liked Hart’s writing. It was precise and concise: every word mattered. I also liked that Hart seemed to take Austin’s theory at its strongest, acknowledging its merits and addressing criticisms that had arisen against his own viewpoint over the years.</p><div class="aside">In baseball, when a runner touches home, their team is awarded a point. Is that just a habit, or is that a rule? Assuming it’s a rule, is it also a moral rule? These are the kinds of questions that Hart gets into.</div><p>This book made me think about questions that I hadn’t thought about before. Much of this book is about demarcating law from non-law (and likewise, rules from habits, and legal rules from moral rules). In the search for a concept of law, you end up needing to check whether a particular definition or description captures those things properly thought of as law and excludes things that aren’t. This is somewhat circular, but Hart takes a pragmatic approach: what distinctions are useful for the kinds of analyses we tend to do?</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="https://www.mla.org/Publications/Bookstore/Nonseries/Literature-as-Exploration-5th-edition">Literature as Exploration</a></em>, Louise Rosenblatt (1933)</div><div class="aside"><em>Democracy implies a society of people who, no matter how much they differ from one another, recognize their common interests, their common goals, and their dependence on mutually honored freedoms and responsibilities.</em>—Louise Rosenblatt</div><p>This book changed the way I think about reading, and art in general. I’ve long held the view that you simply “like what you like”, and  that once an author’s words are out on the page, all that matters is the interpretation that you as a reader bring to the work (FYI, in <em>In Home Alone</em>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/home-alone-is-so-much-better-if-kevin-mccallister-is-dead">Kevin is dead</a>). Rosenblatt’s transactional theory of reading is one of many reader-response theories (of which my view was an extreme). She emphasizes the primacy of your own immediate reaction, but also describes how to evaluate that reaction by looking at how much of it is grounded in the text. This reflection on the causes of your reaction can help you learn more about yourself and others. An ancillary theme is how literature can help develop the empathy necessary for a strong and representative democracy.</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="http://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/My-Own-Words/Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg/9781501145247">My Own Words</a></em>, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (2016)</div><p>The highlights for me were Justice Ginsburg’s early writing, her thoughts on comparative law, and the role of dissent.</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557020/vacationland-by-john-hodgman/9780735224803/">Vacationland</a></em>, John Hodgman (2017)</div></div></li></ul><h2>Articles</h2><ul><li><div><div><em><a href="http://columbialawreview.org/content/bleistein-the-problem-of-aesthetic-progress-and-the-making-of-american-copyright-law/">Bleistein, the Problem of Aesthetic Progress, and the Making of American Copyright Law</a></em>, Barton Beebe (2017)</div><p>Beebe argues that, with respect to copyright, courts should recognize that aesthetic progress can happen when there is simply more art and more people that have made art (Beebe refers to John Dewey’s <em>Art as Experience</em> in describing this view). This would lead courts to find value in more works than they do now, and would support a more expansive fair use exception, allowing more things to be made, even if close copies.</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="http://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/phd/23/">Having a Say: Democracy, Access to Justice and Self-Represented Litigants</a></em>, Jennifer Leitch (2016)</div><p>It is difficult to get meaningful access to justice as a self-represented litigant. The extent to which a person succeeds at   that can affect their participation in other aspects of democracy.</p></div></li><li><div><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/projects/inside-jobs/">Inside Jobs: Hear what American workers have to say about their jobs</a></em>, The Atlantic (2017)</div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2902765">A Transactional Theory of the Reader in Copyright Law</a></em>, Zahr Said (2017)</div><p>How an acceptance of Rosenblatt’s transactional theory of reading would change the questions that we ask jurors and the evidence we give them in copyright cases.</p></div></li><li><div><div><em><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/12/09/gained-in-translation/">Gained in Translation</a></em>, Tim Parks (2017)</div><p>This article put into words the way I’ve come to think about reading.</p><p>“So it’s true that one simply likes or doesn’t like something. [&hellip;] But it’s also true that when preferences shift they do so for a reason, if   not as a result of reasoning. Growing up, one brings more context and experience, more world, to one’s   reading and this “more” changes one’s taste. We might even say this new experience changes the person   and with the person the book. [&hellip;] Our responses and preferences are not arbitrary; they depend on what   we bring to what we read or watch.”</p></div></li></ul><h2>Short stories</h2><ul><li><div><em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/20/the-i-o-u">The I.O.U.</a></em>, F.

I’m not satisfied with how I display the NOTAMs though. They have structure (locations, times, categories), but I’m not using any of that to help pilots quickly determine what’s important to them.</p><p>I’ve been trying to learn how to use a publishing tool called <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen</a>. I used it to lay out the text you’re reading right now. I was looking for something that let me write in plain text, but would still turn that text into a nice-to-read website, or PDF, or whatever. I found some alternatives (Markdown, LaTeX2HTML, Pandoc), but have decided to start with Pollen.</p><div class="aside"><div><em><a href="https://beautifulracket.com/">Beautiful Racket</a></em>, Matthew Butterick (2016)</div></div><p>Because I was trying to learn how to use Pollen, I also learned a bit about Racket, following the book, <em>Beautiful Racket</em>. I like the things I get to think about while writing in Racket, at least as a beginner Racket programmer.</p><h1>Travel</h1><ul><li><div><a href="https://sanchom.wordpress.com/2017/01/27/washington-d-c/">Washington, D.C.</a>: On the week of THE INAUGURATION, I saw Gladys Knight perform at the Kennedy Centre for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, watched two cases argued at the Supreme Court, and visited the Library of Congress, the Capitol Building, and National Public Radio headquarters. My departing flight lifted off at 11:45am on January 20. I thought that because I wasn’t on Earth when the Chief Justice and the PRESIDENT-ELECT recited the magic words, my universe might split in two and I would land on ALT-EARTH where everything was fine. I landed on normal Earth.</div></li><li><div><a href="https://sanchom.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/trip-report-cortes-island-cci9/">Cortes Island</a>: Alison and I flew to Cortes Island to visit some friends who work on a small teaching farm.</div></li><li><div>I visited Winnipeg twice this year: once in the spring for my mom’s birthday and again in the fall  for my Air Cadet squadron’s reunion. It was good to see friends that  were part of the most influential experiences of my life. I’ve been thinking a lot about ambition, privilege,  and finding meaning in work; this was a perfect chance to talk with a bunch of people that I consider  peers and mentors about how they think about those things. I also have a small group of friends that I’ve kept in touch with since high school that I get to see whenever I’m back in Winnipeg. Some have even made little babies and are raising them  to be curious, thoughtful people.</div></li><li><div>I attended <a href="https://con.racket-lang.org/">RacketCon</a> in Seattle. A lot of interesting projects, and a lot of people thinking about languages and functional programming.</div></li></ul><h1>Track</h1><p>The last time I played a game of ultimate was in the spring of 2016, but I hadn’t decided to focus exclusively on track until this year. I like the structured training and predictable progress that I find in track. We pay much more attention to training variables like volume, intensity, and rest periods in track than in ultimate. For me, that makes it more conducive to athletic development and I see it being a sport that I’ll be able to compete in for decades. My <a href="http://athletics.ca/wp-content/themes/default-bs3/popups/athlete-rankings.php?id=8218097&amp;year=0">season bests</a> were 7.51&nbsp;s in the 60&nbsp;m and 11.77&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m.</p><h1>Games</h1><p>I’ve been playing Overwatch and I’m objectively bad (like bottom 5%), but it’s fun. My mains are Soldier&nbsp;76, Junkrat, Orisa, and Mercy.</p><h1>2018</h1><p>I made a resolution in 2017 to not read breaking news. It’s just speculation and guessing games. If I wait for the journalism to sort itself out, I get less worked up about stuff that’s not truly significant and actually understand the significance of the stuff that is. I didn’t completely succeed at this resolution, but when I did, I liked it, and I’ll try again in 2018.</p><p>Starting in January, I’ll be volunteering one day per week with the <a href="https://bccla.org/">BC Civil Liberties Association</a> in a “Communications and Development” position. (I have no idea how much of my actual role is conveyed by that title.) I am excited and nervous about starting this work and I feel privileged to be able to help them with the important work that they do.</p><p>I want to share more of what I write. And I hope that I might also be changed by your thoughts, so do&nbsp;@&nbsp;me!</p></root>
