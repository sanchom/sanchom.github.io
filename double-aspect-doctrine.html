On April 26, 2018, the BC gov­ern­ment asked the BC Court of Appeal to de­cide whether the province has the pow­er to make cer­tain amend­ments to the to the Environmental Management Act that would affect a pro­posed pipeline be­ing built by the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment. See the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0019-000742">news re­lease</a>.

Each is as­signed re­spec­tive spheres of ju­ris­dic­tion by the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.

same ac­tiv­i­ties.</p><p>Multiple Access Ltd was a fed­er­al­ly in­cor­po­rat­ed com­pa­ny, so was with­in scope of the <em>Canada Corporations Act</em>. It also had its pub­lic stock list­ed for trad­ing on the Toronto Stock Exchange, bring­ing it with­in the scope of Ontario’s <em>Securities Act</em>.</p><p>Multiple Access’s share­hold­ers got Ontario’s Securities Commission to com­mence in­sid­er-trad­ing en­force­ment against the com­pa­ny un­der the Ontario act. Those share­hold­ers could have equal­ly sought en­force­ment un­der the fed­er­al act, but the lim­i­ta­tions pe­ri­od un­der the fed­er­al act had ex­pired. This was the only ma­te­r­i­al difference be­tween the two acts as they ap­plied to this com­pa­ny.</p><p>Multiple Access asked the court to de­clare that the fed­er­al act (with the al­ready-ex­pired lim­i­ta­tions pe­ri­od) was valid and thus ren­der the provin­cial law in­valid. That sec­ond step (ren­der­ing the provin­cial law in­valid) would only fol­low if the va­lid­i­ty of a fed­er­al pro­vi­sion pre­cludes the va­lid­i­ty of a near­ly-iden­ti­cal provin­cial law giv­en the di­vi­sion of pow­ers set out in sec­tions 91 and 92 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. Multiple Access ar­gued that a par­tic­u­lar pro­vi­sion could only be valid as ei­ther fed­er­al or provin­cial leg­is­la­tion and that the court had to choose.</p><p>The court used the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine to avoid this choice. It ex­plained the doc­trine us­ing ma­te­r­i­al from an ar­ti­cle by William Lederman, “Classification of Laws and the British North America Act.” Lederman’s ar­ti­cle and <em>Multiple Access</em> con­tem­plate one kind of sce­nario in which the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine can arise (when the court is asked to choose which of the fed­er­al or provin­cial leg­is­la­tures gets to pass a par­tic­u­lar law), but in this sce­nario, two kinds of dou­ble­ness are conflated.</p><p><em>Multiple Access</em> and Lederman’s ar­ti­cle talk about the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine as if the fed­er­al and provin­cial leg­is­la­tures are play­ing tug-of-war over one par­tic­u­lar law, ask­ing, “who gets to en­act it?” Double-as­pect en­ters when the an­swer is, “both of you.” This is the set­ting where we look for a 50/50 split be­tween the provin­cial and fed­er­al fea­tures of a law. If a law has a rough­ly 50/50 split be­tween its provin­cial and fed­er­al fea­tures, then the court will find both the provin­cial and fed­er­al pro­vi­sions valid. This is what hap­pened in <em>Multiple Access</em>.</p><blockquote><p>[…] some over­lap­ping in­evitably re­mains. Where this oc­curs, ei­ther one of two things has then been done. First, the na­ture of <u>the chal­lenged law</u> rel­e­vant to a provin­cial class of pow­ers has been com­plete­ly ig­nored as only an “in­ci­den­tal affectation” of the provin­cial sphere, and <u>the law</u> con­cerned has been classed only by that fea­ture of it rel­e­vant to a fed­er­al class of laws. Thus, in spite of the log­i­cal over­lap the de­ci­sion is made that only the fed­er­al Parliament has pow­er to en­act <u>the chal­lenged law</u>. Obviously this de­ci­sion in­volves a judge­ment that the provin­cial fea­ture of <u>the law</u> is quite unim­por­tant rel­a­tive to its fed­er­al fea­ture. On the oth­er hand if the fed­er­al fea­ture be deemed quite unim­por­tant rel­a­tive to the provin­cial fea­ture, then the con­verse de­ci­sion would be made. […]</p><p>But, if the con­trast be­tween the rel­a­tive im­por­tance of the two fea­tures is not so sharp […] the de­ci­sion is made that <u>the chal­lenged rule</u> could be en­act­ed by ei­ther the fed­er­al Parliament or a provin­cial leg­is­la­ture. [em­pha­sis added]</p></blockquote><p>However, the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine is not so nar­row: it is used even when du­pli­ca­tion is not an is­sue. In 1883, the Privy Council char­ac­ter­ized it broad­ly: “sub­jects which in one as­pect and for one pur­pose fall with­in sec­tion 92, may in an­oth­er as­pect and for an­oth­er pur­pose fall with­in sec­tion 91.”<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-7-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="double-aspect-doctrine.html.pm-Hodge" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal="."><em><a href="http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1883/1883_59.html">Hodge v The Queen</a></em>, [1883] UKPC 59<span data-short-form-placeholder="double-aspect-doctrine.html.pm-Hodge"></span>.</span></label></span></span> Some notes in <em>Canadian Constitutional Law</em> try to ex­plain this, but it’s easy to miss.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-8-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none"><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="double-aspect-doctrine.html.pm-Macklem" data-citation-pinpoint="233" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">Patrick Macklem et al, <em>Canadian Constitutional Law</em> (Toronto: Emond, 2016) at 233<span data-short-form-placeholder="double-aspect-doctrine.html.pm-Macklem"></span>.</span></label></span></span> In its broad­est con­cep­tion, the dou­ble-as­pect doc­trine ex­plains any sce­nario where the courts al­low leg­is­la­tion from our two lev­els of gov­ern­ment to touch a par­tic­u­lar field.

Moreover, the fact that Canada can be un­der­stood to be em­pow­ered to deal only with a different mat­ter than the provinces does not change the re­sult­ing ju­ris­dic­tion­al re­al­i­ty that where Canada is em­pow­ered to im­pose a min­i­mum na­tion­al stan­dard, a dou­ble as­pect sit­u­a­tion aris­es: fed­er­al and provin­cial laws ap­ply con­cur­rent­ly, but the fed­er­al law is para­mount.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-18" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-18-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-18-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Even if we were to deny that the double-aspect doctrine would apply in the case where Canada and the provinces are exercising their jurisdiction in relation to different matters, the legal situation will be the same and federal paramountcy will apply in the case of conflict.</label></span></span> From the per­spec­tive of provin­cial au­ton­o­my, the cor­ro­sive effect is the same.
