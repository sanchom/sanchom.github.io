In September, I'll be entering second year at UBC's Allard School of
Law (class of 2021). I want use law to help give the weakest of us a
voice, in the legal system and in society in general. This includes
civil liberties, especially free expression and defendants' rights. I
want to help with public legal education and access-to-justice
initiatives, to give more of us more confidence in the outcomes of the
legal system and other government decision-making processes. I'm also
interested in the many overlaps of law and technology.

I'm trained as a computer scientist. In that field, I've focused on
visual object recognition, machine learning, and applications of deep
neural networks.

Formerly: data scientist at Kobo, head of R&D at Shelfie,
communications-and-development volunteer at the ◊a[#:href

officer (Cadet Instructor Cadre), 2× Google intern.
