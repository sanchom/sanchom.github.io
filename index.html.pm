I just completed 3L at UBC's Allard School of Law. I spent my final
term at the Indigenous Community Legal Clinic. In summer 2021, I am
working on some personal research and writing projects and doing some
volunteer work. Long term, I hope to do work that gives more of us
more confidence in the outcomes of the legal system and government
decision-making in general. I am very interested in the many overlaps
of law and technology.

I was on the [Gale Moot](https://www.galecupmoot.com/) team, was the
Senior Editor at the [Canadian Journal of Family
Law](http://faculty.allard.ubc.ca/cdnjfl/), and organized a reading
group on [Algorithmic Decision-Making and the Rule of
Law](https://github.com/sanchom/algorithmic-decision-making-and-rule-of-law).

I'm trained as a computer scientist. In that field, I've focused on
visual object recognition, machine learning, and applications of deep
neural networks.
