Welcome! I am a computer scientist trained in law.◊note{PhD (Computer
Science), 2014, University of British Columbia; JD, 2021, Peter
A. Allard School of Law.} I want to help demystify the law and give us
more confidence in the outcomes of the legal system and government
decision-making. I am interested in the many overlaps of law and
technology, especially algorithmic decision-making and copyright, but also administrative law

The views expressed on this blog are my own personal perspective and
do not represent those of the Department of Justice or the Government
of Canada.

In law school, I spent a term at the Indigenous Community Legal
Clinic, was Senior Editor for the Canadian Journal of Family Law, and
convened a reading group on algorithms and the rule of law. After, I
clerked at the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and the Supreme
Court of Canada.

As a computer scientist, I've focused on visual object recognition,
machine learning, and applications of deep neural networks. I stay up
to date with recent publications and have continued to review for
[ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), and
[NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/).

All of my work is connected to the relationships that I've been part
of over the years: family, friends, instructors, supervisors and
mentors, students, and the places that I've lived. I am a
[settler](https://apihtawikosisan.com/2020/02/settling-on-a-name-names-for-non-indigenous-canadians/)
born in Winnipeg, [Treaty 1
Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_1), traditional
territory of the Anishinaabe, Cree, Oji-Cree, and Dakota Peoples, and
the homeland of the Métis Nation. I now live in Vancouver, which
overlaps with the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territories of
the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh.◊note{Learn more about the
