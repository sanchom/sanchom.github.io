◊define-meta[snippet]{How to research statutory and legislative history of Canadian statutory law.}

Welcome to this short series on statutory research. I want to help you
research statutory and legislative history of Canadian statutory
law.◊note{By ◊em{statutory history}, I mean the evolution of an Act
over time. By ◊em{legislative history}, I mean the record of the
legislative process that leads to an enacted statute. And for the
meaning of ◊em{Act} and ◊em{statute}, read on!} This will allow you to
understand the content of an Act at any point in time and to find out
what legislators said about bills prior to their passage into law.

By the end of this series, you should be able to do the following.

◊ol{
◊li{Identify the statutory sources of an Act and any amendments that have
occured to an Act throughout its history. That means finding the
statutes and bills from which the Act and any amendments to it arose.}

◊li{Find the legislative debates associated with those bills.}

◊li{Determine when the Act (or an amendment to it) came into force.}
}

This page will be a work-in-progress that I think will eventually
expand to four small modules. I will update this page as I complete
the material for each.

◊b{What this series omits, but I want you to be aware of, are methods
of research into Indigenous laws and legal traditions.} I have no
practical experience with those methods of research. In the series
developed on this page, you will see that even researching what Canada
has written down about its legislated law can be complicated. It is
all that more complex to research Indigenous law that may or may not
be in written form and that is in various stages of revitalization,
depending on the particular Indigenous nation. To learn more about
this, I recommend reading about the work of the [Indigenous Law
Research Unit](https://ilru.ca/) at the University of Victoria; a
[special issue of the McGill Law
Journal](https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/issue/volume-61-issue-4-2016/)
on Indigenous law, legal orders, and traditions; and a collection of
essays edited by Michael Asch, John Borrows, and James Tully,
◊a[#:href

and Reconciliation: Indigenous--Settler Relations and Earth
Teachings}}.

I also want to emphasize, especially for anyone coming to this series
who is not in law school, that ◊b{this is not how to figure out what
◊red{The Law} is}. It is only how to research one kind of material
that contributes to the development of Canadian law. Law is made in
many ways, in many sites, with various materials and through
relationships and human commitments to meanings. What the legislature
has chosen to declare through statute is only one part of how we
create legal meaning together.

Finally, before embarking on any of the research I describe in this
series, always check whether somebody else has done some of the work
for you. There may be a journal article, a court decision, or even a
Wikipedia article that outlines the rough statutory history of an
Act. But even if you use someone else’s work as a starting point, you
will often want to check their work for yourself: did they get every
date exactly right? did they miss any amendments? So whether you have
to start from scratch or if you are starting from someone else's work,
you’ll need to understand what I present in this series.

◊heading{Part 1: The materials}

This first Part covers the ◊em{materials} you will encounter during
this type of research. These materials are: bills, statutes, Acts
including amending Acts, Revised Statutes, official consolidations,
unofficial consolidations, and Hansard records. I will present these
all in this first Part. Another important source is the Canada Gazette
(and the provincial equivalents), but I will leave discussion of the
Gazettes until the final Part in this series.

Here are some rough descriptions of these materials I just mentioned.

◊b{A bill}: the piece of legislation that is developed in Parliament
(or a provincial legislature).◊note{Going forward, I will not
distinguish between Parliament and provincial legislatures unless
significant.} A bill is what the Parliament drafts, debates, amends,
and passes.◊note{A bill is often originally drafted by the executive
branch of government for introduction to Parliament.} A bill passed by
Parliament becomes an Act upon Royal Assent.◊note{This series will not
focus on the full internal process of what happens in Parliament, but
[here is a good discussion between Professor Craig Forcese and
Professor John Mark
Keyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRWyJddRIPU) on the legislative
process.}

In Parliament, bills are labelled starting with a ◊em{C-} if they
originate in the House of Commons and they are labelled starting with
an ◊em{S-} if they originate in the Senate. Numbering starts over at
the beginning of each legislative session. Some Acts that gained notoriety prior
to their passage are often known by their bill number for quite some
time because this is how the media and commentators would have been
referring to them.

For example, in 2021, there was a [Bill
C-10](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10926636)
("An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make consequential
amendments to other Acts"). Look at some of the headlines: "Heritage
Minister asks senators to focus on passing Bill C-10," "Feds admit
Bill C-10 faces opposition across the country." These are ambiguous
without context, because there is a Bill C-10 in every session of
Parliament. See e.g. [Bill C-10 from the 43rd Parliament, 1st
Session](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=8139986),
and [Bill C-10 from the 42nd Parliament, 1st
Session](https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=10687311).

◊b{Hansard}. ◊em{Hansard} refers to the record of what the legislature
did with and said about a bill during its progress through
Parliament.◊note{Named after the first official publisher of
Parliamentary debates in the British Parliament.}

◊b{A statute}. A statute is the written text of the Act as ultimately
enacted by Parliament. These are published in annual volumes entitled
◊em{Statutes of Canada} (or more simply, ◊em{Annual
Statutes}).◊note{Provinces have an equivalent.}

◊b{An Act} has a dual-meaning. It can refer to the enacted Bill (the
thing that receives Royal Assent and which is published as a statute
in the annual volume). It also refers to the evolving, abstract object
that gets amended over time. For example, the ◊em{Assisted Human
Reproduction Act} is the title of a statute that was passed in
2004. It has been amended since then and the name ◊em{Assisted Human
Reproduction Act} continues to refer to the current and changing
content of that Act.

◊b{Revised Statutes}. Several times in Canada's history (1886, 1906,
1927, 1952, 1970, 1985), Parliament has passed what are called
◊em{Revised Statutes}. These are when Parliament brings together all
amendments that have occurred to all the existing Acts over time and
enacts an updated version of each of those Acts. These updated
versions incorporate directly into their text the most up-to-date
amended language. The Revised Statutes have hundreds of chapters, one
for each Act that was in force at the time.

◊fig[#:src "assets/RSC-1985-TOC.png"]{The first page of the table of
contents of the 1985 Revised Statutes of Canada. Each Act that was in
force at the time gets its own chapter.}

In between the publication of Revised Statutes, you have to put
together the content of an Act by looking at all amendments that have
happened to an Act since its original passage or since the most recent
Revised Statute. But ◊em{consolidated} acts can help you with this.

◊b{Unofficial consolidations}, from providers like WestLaw, CanLii, or
Canada's Justice Laws website (prior to 2009) attempt to present what
the content of an Act is right now or at any point in time (going back
only so far, though). See e.g. ◊a[#:href
"https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/laws/stat/sbc-1953-c-55/latest/sbc-1953-c-55.html#history"]{CanLii's
unofficial consolidation(s) of the ◊em{Vancouver Charter} from 2008
until now}. These are generally helpful only for recent
decades. E.g. You won't find good unofficial consolidations for Acts
as they existed in 1925.

◊b{Official consolidations} (e.g. [Canada's Justice
Laws](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/) website since 2009)
provide authoritative evidence of the content of an Act is right now
or at at any point in time (again, only going back so far).◊note{This
[note from the Department of
Justice](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ImportantNote/) explains
what changed in 2009.}

The decision to produce official revisions and/or consolidations and
the process for doing so differs between federal Parliament and
provincial legislatures and the practices have changed over time. In
this series, I will be focusing on the approach take by the federal
Parliament and the BC legislature. If you're doing work in another
provice, these general principles should help you understand the
approach taken by your province, but you'll need to take some time to
understand the particular system(s) used in your jurisdiction.

◊sub-heading{An example: the ◊em{Copyright Act}}

For the rest of this Part, I will present a federal Act, the
◊em{Copyright Act}, and point out how all the materials I just
presented contribute to the product that we see today.

◊b{Today, an official consolidation}

First, to see the ◊em{Copyright Act} as it exists today, we can rely
on the ◊em{official consolidation} provided by Canada's Justice Laws
website. Here are direct links to the full, up-to-date content of the
Act as officially consolidated:
[HTML](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/FullText.html);
[PDF](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/C-42.pdf). It incorporates
the effects of all amendments that are in force.

◊b{Original}

While it is debatable what the "original" ◊em{Copyright Act} was, a
version with the structure that has lasted until today was passed in
1921.◊note{Its actual short title was ◊em{The Copyright Act,
1921}. The year was part of the name! This can get confusing,
especially since when referring to the Act as later amended, it would
still be called ◊em{The Copyright Act, 1921}. There were also
precursor ◊em{Copyright Act}s, but this was the first Act that pulled
all the parts together into a single Act.} It was published in the
annual volume ◊em{11--12 George V} in 1921,◊note{At this time, the
annual statutes were titled using the [regnal
year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_year).} and you can read it
[here](assets/SC-1921-c-24).

◊b{1985 official revised version}

The ◊em{Copyright Act} was around during Canada's most recent Revised
Statute project (1985), so it was included as a chapter there (chapter
C-42). You can read that chapter [here](assets/RSC-1985-C-42.pdf).

◊b{A 2012 amendment}

The ◊em{Copyright Act} has been amended many times between 1985 and
today, including in 2012 when Parliament made many changes to the fair
dealing user rights. The 2012 amending Act can be found in the [Annual
Statutes of Canada 2012, Chapter
20](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/index2012.html). Here
is its full text
([HTML](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_20/FullText.html);
[PDF](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/2012_20.pdf)). It was
entitled the ◊em{Copyright Modernization Act} and went through
Parliament being known as Bill C-11. You can follow the [life of Bill
C-11 on
LegisInfo](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&billId=5134851),
including links to committee hearings and Hansard records.

◊b{◊em{Copyright Act} summary}

I showed you a very early version published in 1921. I skipped over
many amendments but showed you that the 1985 Revised Statutes included
the ◊em{Copyright Act} at Chapter C-42. And I showed you an amending
Act: developed as Bill C-11, published as a statute in the Annual
Statutes of 2012, the effects of which are now part of the current
official consolidation on the Justice Laws website.

◊sub-heading{Concluding Part 1}

In this Part, I have only introduced you to the materials involved in
statutory research and by example showed you some of the ways of
accessing them. You should know what a bill is; what a statute is; the
dual-meaning of the word ◊em{Act} and that Acts can evolve over time;
that governments may create official consolidations of Acts and that
the Parliament very occasionally creates Revised Statutes.

In my examples, I have mostly shown you the simplest, modern modes of
accessing these materials (e.g. the official consolidation;
Parliament’s LegisInfo portal which links together bills and Hansard
in a helpful way). Once you go back a bit further in time, it becomes
more complicated to identify the evolution of an Act over time and to
identify the associated statutes, bills, and Hansard records.

That is what I will share with you in the following Parts: how to
actually ◊em{find} these materials and various methods of research
that are effective across different eras.
