    <root><p>Welcome to this short se­ries on statu­to­ry re­search.

That means finding the statutes and bills from which the Act and any amend­ments to it arose.</li><li>Find the leg­isla­tive de­bates as­so­ci­at­ed with those bills.</li><li>Determine when the Act (or an amend­ment to it) came into force.</li></ol><p>This page will be a work-in-progress that I think will even­tu­al­ly ex­pand to four small mod­ules. I will up­date this page as I com­plete the ma­te­r­i­al for each.</p><p><b>What this se­ries omits, but I want you to be aware of, are meth­ods of re­search into Indigenous laws and le­gal tra­di­tions.</b> I have no prac­ti­cal ex­pe­ri­ence with those meth­ods of re­search. In the se­ries de­vel­oped on this page, you will see that even re­search­ing what Canada has writ­ten down about its leg­is­lat­ed law can be com­pli­cat­ed. It is all that more com­plex to re­search Indigenous law that may or may not be in writ­ten form and that is in var­i­ous stages of re­vi­tal­iza­tion, de­pend­ing on the par­tic­u­lar Indigenous na­tion. To learn more about this, I rec­om­mend read­ing about the work of the <a href="https://ilru.ca/">Indigenous Law Research Unit</a> at the University of Victoria; a <a href="https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/issue/volume-61-issue-4-2016/">spe­cial is­sue of the McGill Law Journal</a> on Indigenous law, le­gal or­ders, and tra­di­tions; and a col­lec­tion of es­says edit­ed by Michael Asch, John Borrows, and James Tully, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39653926-resurgence-and-reconciliation"><em>Resurgence and Reconciliation: Indigenous–Settler Relations and Earth Teachings</em></a>.</p><p>I also want to em­pha­size, es­pe­cial­ly for any­one com­ing to this se­ries who is not in law school, that <b>this is not how to figure out what <span class="red">The Law</span> is</b>. It is only how to re­search one kind of ma­te­r­i­al that con­tributes to the de­vel­op­ment of Canadian law. Law is made in many ways, in many sites, with var­i­ous ma­te­ri­als and through re­la­tion­ships and hu­man com­mit­ments to mean­ings. What the leg­is­la­ture has cho­sen to de­clare through statute is only one part of how we cre­ate le­gal mean­ing to­geth­er.</p><p>Finally, be­fore em­bark­ing on any of the re­search I de­scribe in this se­ries, al­ways check whether some­body else has done some of the work for you. There may be a jour­nal ar­ti­cle, a court de­ci­sion, or even a Wikipedia ar­ti­cle that out­lines the rough statu­to­ry his­to­ry of an Act. But even if you use some­one else’s work as a start­ing point, you will of­ten want to check their work for your­self: did they get every date ex­act­ly right? did they miss any amend­ments? So whether you have to start from scratch or if you are start­ing from some­one else’s work, you’ll need to un­der­stand what I present in this se­ries.</p><h2 hyphens="none">Part 1: The materials</h2><p>This first Part cov­ers the <em>ma­te­ri­als</em> you will en­counter dur­ing this type of re­search. These ma­te­ri­als are: bills, statutes, Acts in­clud­ing amend­ing Acts, Revised Statutes, official con­sol­i­da­tions, unofficial con­sol­i­da­tions, and Hansard records. I will present these all in this first Part. Another im­por­tant source is the Canada Gazette (and the provin­cial equiv­a­lents), but I will leave dis­cus­sion of the Gazettes un­til the final Part in this se­ries.</p><p>Here are some rough de­scrip­tions of these ma­te­ri­als I just men­tioned.</p><p><b>A bill</b>: the piece of leg­is­la­tion that is de­vel­oped in Parliament (or a provin­cial leg­is­la­ture).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-2-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Going forward, I will not distinguish between Parliament and provincial legislatures unless significant.</label></span></span> A bill is what the Parliament drafts, de­bates, amends, and pass­es.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-3-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-3-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">A bill is often originally drafted by the executive branch of government for introduction to Parliament.</label></span></span> A bill passed by Parliament be­comes an Act upon Royal Assent.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-4-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">This series will not focus on the full internal process of what happens in Parliament, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRWyJddRIPU">here is a good discussion between Professor Craig Forcese and Professor John Mark Keyes</a> on the legislative process. See also <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_16_5-e.html"><em>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</em></a>, 3rd ed (2017), Chapter 16: “The Legislative Process.”</label></span></span></p><p>In Parliament, bills are la­belled start­ing with a <em>C-</em> if they orig­i­nate in the House of Commons and they are la­belled start­ing with an <em>S-</em> if they orig­i­nate in the Senate. Numbering starts over at the be­gin­ning of each leg­isla­tive ses­sion. Some Acts that gained no­to­ri­ety pri­or to their pas­sage are of­ten known by their bill num­ber for quite some time be­cause this is how the me­dia and com­men­ta­tors would have been re­fer­ring to them.</p><p>For ex­am­ple, in 2021, there was a <a href="https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;billId=10926636">Bill C&ndash;10</a> (“An Act to amend the Broadcasting Act and to make con­se­quen­tial amend­ments to oth­er Acts”). Look at some of the head­lines: “Heritage Minister asks sen­a­tors to fo­cus on pass­ing Bill C-10,” “Feds ad­mit Bill C-10 faces op­po­si­tion across the coun­try.” These are am­bigu­ous with­out con­text, be­cause there is a Bill C-10 in every ses­sion of Parliament. See e.g. <a href="https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;billId=8139986">Bill C&ndash;10 from the 43rd Parliament, 1st Session</a>, and <a href="https://www.parl.ca/LegisInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;billId=10687311">Bill C&ndash;10 from the 42nd Parliament, 1st Session</a>.</p><p><b>Hansard</b>. <em>Hansard</em> refers to the record of what the leg­is­la­ture did with and said about a bill dur­ing its progress through Parliament.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-5-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Named after the first official publisher of Parliamentary debates in the British Parliament.</label></span></span></p><p><b>A statute</b>. A statute is the writ­ten text of the Act as ul­ti­mate­ly en­act­ed by Parliament. These are pub­lished in an­nu­al vol­umes en­ti­tled <em>Statutes of Canada</em> (or more sim­ply, <em>Annual Statutes</em>).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-6" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-6-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-6-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Provinces have an equivalent.</label></span></span></p><p><b>An Act</b> has a dual-mean­ing. It can re­fer to the en­act­ed Bill (the thing that re­ceives Royal Assent and which is pub­lished as a statute in the an­nu­al vol­ume). It also refers to the evolv­ing, ab­stract ob­ject that gets amend­ed over time. For ex­am­ple, the <em>Assisted Human Reproduction Act</em> is the ti­tle of a statute that was passed in 2004. It has been amend­ed since then and the name <em>Assisted Human Reproduction Act</em> con­tin­ues to re­fer to the cur­rent and chang­ing con­tent of that Act.</p><p><b>Revised Statutes</b>. Several times in Canada’s his­to­ry (1886, 1906, 1927, 1952, 1970, 1985), Parliament has passed what are called <em>Revised Statutes</em>.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-7-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-7-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">An <a href="assets/RSC-1985-Explanatory-note.pdf">explanatory note</a> included in the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, gives some helpful background to the process. No revision process or output is identical. The Statute Revision Commission has flexibility and discretion in how it approaches its task. In a later Part, I will present in more detail how to understand the 1985 revision and its supplements.</label></span></span> These are when Parliament brings to­geth­er all amend­ments that have oc­curred to all the ex­ist­ing Acts over time and en­acts an up­dat­ed ver­sion of each of those Acts. These up­dat­ed ver­sions in­cor­po­rate di­rect­ly into their text the most up-to-date amend­ed lan­guage. They are not in­tend­ed to be new law. They are only meant to con­sol­i­date and de­clare anew “the law as con­tained in the Acts... for which the Revised Statutes are sub­sti­tut­ed.” The Revised Statutes have hun­dreds of chap­ters, one for each Act that was in force at the time.</p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/RSC-1985-TOC.png"/></p><figcaption>The first page of the ta­ble of con­tents of the 1985 Revised Statutes of Canada. Each Act that was in force at the time gets its own chap­ter.</figcaption></figure><p>In be­tween the pub­li­ca­tion of Revised Statutes, you have to put to­geth­er the con­tent of an Act by look­ing at all amend­ments that have hap­pened to an Act since its orig­i­nal pas­sage or since the most re­cent Revised Statute. But <em>con­sol­i­dat­ed</em> acts can help you with this.</p><p><b>Unofficial con­sol­i­da­tions</b>, from providers like WestLaw, CanLii, or Canada’s Justice Laws web­site (pri­or to 2009) at­tempt to present what the con­tent of an Act is right now or at any point in time (go­ing back only so far, though). See e.g. <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/laws/stat/sbc-1953-c-55/latest/sbc-1953-c-55.html#history">CanLii’s unofficial con­sol­i­da­tion(s) of the <em>Vancouver Charter</em> from 2008 un­til now</a>. These are gen­er­al­ly help­ful only for re­cent decades. E.g. You won’t find good unofficial con­sol­i­da­tions for Acts as they ex­ist­ed in 1925.</p><p><b>Official con­sol­i­da­tions</b> (e.g. <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/">Canada’s Justice Laws</a> web­site since 2009) pro­vide au­thor­i­ta­tive ev­i­dence of the con­tent of an Act is right now or at at any point in time (again, only go­ing back so far).<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-8-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-8-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">This <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ImportantNote/">note from the Department of Justice</a> explains what changed in 2009.</label></span></span></p><p>The de­ci­sion to pro­duce official re­vi­sions and/or con­sol­i­da­tions and the process for do­ing so differs be­tween fed­er­al Parliament and provin­cial leg­is­la­tures and the prac­tices have changed over time. In this se­ries, I will be fo­cus­ing on the ap­proach take by the fed­er­al Parliament and the BC leg­is­la­ture. If you’re do­ing work in an­oth­er province, these gen­er­al prin­ci­ples should help you un­der­stand the ap­proach tak­en by your province, but you’ll need to take some time to un­der­stand the par­tic­u­lar sys­tem(s) used in your ju­ris­dic­tion.</p><h3 hyphens="none">An example: the <em>Copyright Act</em></h3><p>For the rest of this Part, I will present a fed­er­al Act, the <em>Copyright Act</em>, and point out how all the ma­te­ri­als I just pre­sent­ed con­tribute to the prod­uct that we see to­day.</p><p><b>Today, an official con­sol­i­da­tion</b></p><p>First, to see the <em>Copyright Act</em> as it ex­ists to­day, we can rely on the <em>official con­sol­i­da­tion</em> pro­vid­ed by Canada’s Justice Laws web­site.

This would have be­come ap­par­ent through re­search­ing sec­ondary sources and Hansard. If I were do­ing this re­search for real, I would want to un­der­stand what that pre­vi­ous com­mis­sion looked like and whether Parliament in­tend­ed the new CRTC to be like the old CRTC.</p><p>To sum­ma­rize, the en­tire his­to­ry of Section 3 of the <em>CRTC Act</em> is cap­tured by:</p><ul><li>SC 1974-75-76, c 49, s 3;</li><li>RSC 1985, c C-22, s 3;</li><li>SC 1991, c 11, s 76;</li><li>SC 2010, c 12, s 1701.</li></ul><p>When did the Commission change size? Upon ini­tial cre­ation and in 1985, the Commission was made up of up to nine full-time mem­bers and ten part-time mem­bers. Today, it is made up of no more than thir­teen mem­bers. Did that change hap­pen in 1991? Or did it hap­pen in 2010? To dis­cov­er this, we need to look at the Statutes of Canada in 1991 and 2010.</p><p>For the 1991 amend­ment, I need to rely on HeinOnline again (the <a href="https://heinonline-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/HOL/Index?collection=caotp">di­rect link</a> for UBC peo­ple). Statutes of Canada 1991, Chapter 11 was in fact a new <em>Broadcasting Act</em> with the struc­ture that we see to­day.

Sections 1 through 71 become the substantive content of the <em>Broadcasting Act</em>. Sections 72 and onward are quite different. Sections 72 and onward mostly repeal, amend, or replace various sections of other Acts. In particular, Section 76 is the Section that amends the <em>CRTC Act</em> to change the size of the CRTC.</label></span></span></p><figure><p><img potential-feature="potential-feature" src="assets/SC-1991-c-11-s-75-77.png"/></p><figcaption>This is Section 76 of Chapter 11 of the Annual Statutes of Canada, 1991.

There, we see that the <em>CRTC Act</em> was amend­ed to read as it does to­day: “not more than 13 mem­bers” and no men­tion of part-time mem­bers. Section 1702 amends Section 4 of the <em>CRTC Act</em> to say that all mem­bers are full-time mem­bers: “A mem­ber shall de­vote the whole of his or her time to the per­for­mance of his or her du­ties un­der this Act.”</p><h3 hyphens="none">Enactment does not imply in force</h3><p>So far, I have only shown you how to find the statu­to­ry ma­te­r­i­al that has con­tributed to the con­tent of the Act.

Coville (Senior Director, Department of Transportation and Communications, Province of Nova Scotia) said, “we wish to re­it­er­ate our sup­port for the pro­vi­sions in the leg­is­la­tion al­low­ing for the ap­point­ment of full-time com­mis­sion­ers who would re­side in the re­gions they rep­re­sent, in­creas­ing the num­ber of full-time com­mis­sion­ers from 9 to 13 … the cu­mu­la­tive effect of these pro­vi­sions will be a more efficient, effective, and re­gion­al­ly sen­si­tive com­mis­sion.”</li></ul><p>I would go fur­ther if I were do­ing this re­search for real, but that is the kind of in­for­ma­tion you can find out of the com­mit­tee re­ports. These state­ments don’t nec­es­sar­i­ly reflect leg­isla­tive in­tent, but do re­veal con­text that was avail­able to Parliament. The clause that changed the com­po­si­tion of the CRTC was not amend­ed by the com­mit­tee nor dis­cussed at the re­port stage. I would com­plete this re­search by re­peat­ing all of the above for the Senate records.</p><h3 hyphens="none">Modern (post-1994) bills</h3><p>This only gets eas­i­er as you move to­wards the present-day. Instead of search­ing through text ex­tract­ed from PDF scans, you get to seach di­rect­ly in the raw text of the ma­te­ri­als, and the Parliament web­sites or­ga­nize and link the ma­te­r­i­al to­geth­er in a much more help­ful way.</p><p>On my next up­date of this post, I will present a short ex­am­ple of how to do this re­search on a mod­ern bill.
