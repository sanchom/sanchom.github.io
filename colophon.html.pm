I write this site using ◊a[#:href "https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"]{Emacs} and
◊a[#:href "https://racket-lang.org/"]{DrRacket} in a custom markup language that is
then rendered into HTML and CSS using the ◊a[#:href "http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/"]{Pollen}
publishing program. The source for this site is ◊a[#:href "https://github.com/sanchom/sanchom.github.io"]{here}.

Citation style is from the Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation,
supplemented with the Chicago Manual of Style.

I have been heavily influenced by Matthew Butterick's ◊em{◊a[#:href "https://practicaltypography.com/"]{Practical Typography}}
and I copied many CSS techniques (e.g. underlining, responsive margin notes) from ◊a[#:href "https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/"]{Tufte CSS}.
