L. A. Hart (1961)</span></p><p>Hart’s con­cept of law com­pris­es pri­ma­ry rules that tell us what to do and sec­ondary rules of recog­ni­tion, ad­ju­di­ca­tion, and change. He con­trasts this with Austin’s the­o­ry that law is just a bunch of or­ders backed by threats.</p><p>I liked Hart’s writ­ing. It was pre­cise and con­cise: every word mat­tered.

In the search for a con­cept of law, you end up need­ing to check whether a par­tic­u­lar definition or de­scrip­tion cap­tures those things prop­er­ly thought of as law and ex­cludes things that aren’t. This is some­what cir­cu­lar, but Hart takes a prag­mat­ic ap­proach: what dis­tinc­tions are use­ful for the kinds of analy­ses we tend to do?</p></div></li><li><div><p><span><em><a href="https://www.mla.org/Publications/Bookstore/Nonseries/Literature-as-Exploration-5th-edition">Literature as Exploration</a></em>, Louise Rosenblatt (1933)</span></p><p>This book changed the way I think about read­ing, and art in gen­er­al. I’ve long held the view that you sim­ply “like what you like”, and  that once an au­thor’s words are out on the page, all that mat­ters is the in­ter­pre­ta­tion that you as a read­er bring to the work (FYI, in <em>In Home Alone</em>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/home-alone-is-so-much-better-if-kevin-mccallister-is-dead">Kevin is dead</a>). Rosenblatt’s trans­ac­tion­al the­o­ry of read­ing is one of many read­er-re­sponse the­o­ries (of which my view was an ex­treme). She em­pha­sizes the pri­ma­cy of your own im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion, but also de­scribes how to eval­u­ate that re­ac­tion by look­ing at how much of it is ground­ed in the text. This reflection on the caus­es of your re­ac­tion can help you learn more about your­self and oth­ers. An an­cil­lary theme is how lit­er­a­ture can help de­vel­op the em­pa­thy nec­es­sary for a strong and rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­moc­ra­cy. <span><label for="2124527018" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="2124527018" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="1093418549" class="margin-expand"/><label for="1093418549" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none"><em>Democracy im­plies a so­ci­ety of peo­ple who, no mat­ter how much they differ from one an­oth­er, rec­og­nize their com­mon in­ter­ests, their com­mon goals, and their de­pen­dence on mu­tu­al­ly hon­ored free­doms and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</em>—Louise Rosenblatt</label></span></p></div></li><li><div><p><span><em><a href="http://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/My-Own-Words/Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg/9781501145247">My Own Words</a></em>, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (2016)</span></p><p>The high­lights for me were Justice Ginsburg’s ear­ly writ­ing, her thoughts on com­par­a­tive law, and the role of dis­sent.</p></div></li><li><div><span><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557020/vacationland-by-john-hodgman/9780735224803/">Vacationland</a></em>, John Hodgman (2017)</span></div></li></ul><h3 hyphens="none">Articles</h3><ul><li><div><p><span><em><a href="http://columbialawreview.org/content/bleistein-the-problem-of-aesthetic-progress-and-the-making-of-american-copyright-law/">Bleistein, the Problem of Aesthetic Progress, and the Making of American Copyright Law</a></em>, Barton Beebe (2017)</span></p><p>Beebe ar­gues that, with re­spect to copy­right, courts should rec­og­nize that aes­thet­ic progress can hap­pen when there is sim­ply more art and more peo­ple that have made art (Beebe refers to John Dewey’s <em>Art as Experience</em> in de­scrib­ing this view).

I like the struc­tured train­ing and pre­dictable progress that I find in track. We pay much more at­ten­tion to train­ing vari­ables like vol­ume, in­ten­si­ty, and rest pe­ri­ods in track than in ul­ti­mate. For me, that makes it more con­ducive to ath­let­ic de­vel­op­ment and I see it be­ing a sport that I’ll be able to com­pete in for decades.
