In the search for a con­cept of law, you end up need­ing to check whether a par­tic­u­lar definition or de­scrip­tion cap­tures those things prop­er­ly thought of as law and ex­cludes things that aren’t.

I’ve long held the view that you sim­ply “like what you like”, and that once an au­thor’s words are out on the page, all that mat­ters is the in­ter­pre­ta­tion that you as a read­er bring to the work (FYI, in <em>In Home Alone</em>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/home-alone-is-so-much-better-if-kevin-mccallister-is-dead">Kevin is dead</a>). Rosenblatt’s trans­ac­tion­al the­o­ry of read­ing is one of many read­er-re­sponse the­o­ries (of which my view was an ex­treme). She em­pha­sizes the pri­ma­cy of your own im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion, but also de­scribes how to eval­u­ate that re­ac­tion by look­ing at how much of it is ground­ed in the text. This reflection on the caus­es of your re­ac­tion can help you learn more about your­self and oth­ers. An an­cil­lary theme is how lit­er­a­ture can help de­vel­op the em­pa­thy nec­es­sary for a strong and rep­re­sen­ta­tive democ­ra­cy. <span><label for="mn-2" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="mn-2-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="mn-2-expand" class="margin-note expanded" hyphens="none"><em>Democracy im­plies a so­ci­ety of peo­ple who, no mat­ter how much they differ from one an­oth­er, rec­og­nize their com­mon in­ter­ests, their com­mon goals, and their de­pen­dence on mu­tu­al­ly hon­ored free­doms and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</em>—Louise Rosenblatt</label></span></p><p><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="unidentified-work-5" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">Ruth Bader Ginsburg, <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.ca/books/My-Own-Words/Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg/9781501145247"><em>My Own Words</em></a> (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2016)<span data-short-form-pre-placeholder="unidentified-work-5"></span>.</span></p><p>The high­lights for me were Justice Ginsburg’s ear­ly writ­ing, her thoughts on com­par­a­tive law, and the role of dis­sent.</p><p><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="unidentified-work-6" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">John Hodgman, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557020/vacationland-by-john-hodgman/9780735224803/"><em>Vacationland</em></a> (New York: Viking, 2017)<span data-short-form-pre-placeholder="unidentified-work-6"></span>.</span></p><h3 hyphens="none">Articles</h3><p><span class="bibliography-entry full-form-citation" data-citation-id="unidentified-work-7" data-citation-pinpoint="false" data-citation-parenthetical="false" data-citation-judge="false" data-citation-speaker="false" data-citation-signal="false" data-citation-terminal=".">Barton Beebe, “<a href="http://columbialawreview.org/content/bleistein-the-problem-of-aesthetic-progress-and-the-making-of-american-copyright-law/">Bleistein, the Problem of Aesthetic Progress, and the Making of American Copyright Law</a>” (2017) 112:2 Columbia Law Review 319<span data-short-form-pre-placeholder="unidentified-work-7"></span>.</span></p><p>Beebe ar­gues that, with re­spect to copy­right, courts should rec­og­nize that aes­thet­ic progress can hap­pen when there is sim­ply more art and more peo­ple that have made art (Beebe refers to John Dewey’s <em>Art as Experience</em> in de­scrib­ing this view).

I found some al­ter­na­tives (Markdown, LaTeX2HTML, Pandoc), but have de­cid­ed to start with Pollen.</p><p>Because I was try­ing to learn how to use Pollen, I also learned a bit about Racket, fol­low­ing the book, <a href="https://beautifulracket.com/"><em>Beautiful Racket</em></a>.

My de­part­ing flight lift­ed off at 11:45am on January 20. I thought that be­cause I wasn’t on Earth when the Chief Justice and the PRESIDENT-ELECT re­cit­ed the mag­ic words, my uni­verse might split in two and I would land on ALT-EARTH where every­thing was fine. I land­ed on nor­mal Earth.</p><p><a href="https://sanchom.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/trip-report-cortes-island-cci9/">Cortes Island</a>:  Alison and I flew to Cortes Island to vis­it some friends who work on a small teach­ing farm.</p><p>I vis­it­ed Winnipeg twice this year: once in the spring for my mom’s birth­day and again in the fall  for my Air Cadet squadron’s re­union. It was good to see friends that were part of the most influential ex­pe­ri­ences of my life. I’ve been think­ing a lot about am­bi­tion, priv­i­lege,  and finding mean­ing in work; this was a per­fect chance to talk with a bunch of peo­ple that I con­sid­er  peers and men­tors about how they think about those things. I also have a small group of friends that I’ve kept in touch with since high school that I get to see when­ev­er I’m back in Winnipeg. Some have even made lit­tle ba­bies and are rais­ing them to be cu­ri­ous, thought­ful peo­ple.</p><p>I at­tend­ed <a href="https://con.racket-lang.org/">RacketCon</a> in Seattle. A lot of in­ter­est­ing projects, and a lot of peo­ple think­ing about lan­guages and func­tion­al pro­gram­ming.</p><h2 hyphens="none">Track</h2><p>The last time I played a game of ul­ti­mate was in the spring of 2016, but I hadn’t de­cid­ed to fo­cus ex­clu­sive­ly on track un­til this year. I like the struc­tured train­ing and pre­dictable progress that I find in track. We pay much more at­ten­tion to train­ing vari­ables like vol­ume, in­ten­si­ty, and rest pe­ri­ods in track than in ul­ti­mate. For me, that makes it more con­ducive to ath­let­ic de­vel­op­ment and I see it be­ing a sport that I’ll be able to com­pete in for decades. My <a href="http://athletics.ca/wp-content/themes/default-bs3/popups/athlete-rankings.php?id=8218097&amp;year=0">sea­son bests</a> were 7.51&nbsp;s in the 60&nbsp;m and 11.77&nbsp;s in the 100&nbsp;m.</p><h2 hyphens="none">Games</h2><p>I’ve been play­ing Overwatch and I’m ob­jec­tive­ly bad (like bot­tom 5%), but it’s fun. My mains are Soldier&nbsp;76, Junkrat, Orisa, and Mercy.</p><h2 hyphens="none">2018</h2><p>I made a res­o­lu­tion in 2017 to not read break­ing news. It’s just spec­u­la­tion and guess­ing games. If I wait for the jour­nal­ism to sort it­self out, I get less worked up about stuff that’s not tru­ly significant and ac­tu­al­ly un­der­stand the significance of the stuff that is.  I didn’t com­plete­ly suc­ceed at this res­o­lu­tion, but when I did, I liked it, and I’ll try again in 2018.</p><p>Starting in January, I’ll be vol­un­teer­ing one day per week with the <a href="https://bccla.org/">BC Civil Liberties Association</a> in a “Communications and Development” po­si­tion. (I have no idea how much of my ac­tu­al role is con­veyed by that ti­tle.) I am ex­cit­ed about start­ing this work and I feel priv­i­leged to be able to help them with the im­por­tant work that they do.</p><p>I want to share more of what I write. And I hope that I might also be changed by your thoughts, so do&nbsp;@&nbsp;me!</p><div class="endnotes print-only"></div></root>
