<h1>Avoid leaky links: don’t reveal your research</h1><div class="byline">By Sancho McCann · <span class="date">

    <root><h3 hyphens="none">URLs should be as plain as possible</h3><p>Uniform re­source lo­ca­tors (URLs) have been used since the ear­ly 1990s to spec­i­fy des­ti­na­tions on the in­ter­net. If you look or scroll up, you’ll see this page’s URL:</p><p><span class="code">https://san­chom.github.io/leaky-links.html</span></p><p>These are some­times just called <em>ad­dress­es</em>. When click­able, these are called <em>links</em> or <em>hy­per­links</em>.</p><p>It has also long been ac­cept­ed, and in­creas­ing­ly ex­pect­ed, to pro­vide URLs, of­ten via a click­able link, in court doc­u­ments. For ex­am­ple, the <a href="https://www.fct-cf.gc.ca/Content/assets/pdf/base/2023-12-20_Amended_Consolidated_General_Practice_Guidelines.pdf">December 2023 Amended Consolidated General Practice Guidelines of the Federal Court</a> al­lows you to avoid filing a book of au­thor­i­ties (a doc­u­ment with a copy of each case cit­ed to) if you in­stead in­clude hy­per­links for all cas­es that are cit­ed in the mem­o­ran­dum of ar­gu­ment.</p><p>Judges and coun­sel of­ten in­clude URLs in their writ­ting when re­fer­ring to ma­te­r­i­al that is avail­able on­line.</p><h3 hyphens="none">A URL can inadvertently reveal much more</h3><p>The URL can spec­i­fy more than just the des­ti­na­tion site and page. Often, URLs em­bed track­ing in­for­ma­tion. Below is a URL to a Youtube video. Everything af­ter the ques­tion mark is un­nec­es­sary and is like­ly a track­ing ID that re­veals to Youtube that this is a link that <em>I</em> have shared with you.</p><p><span class="code">https://youtu.be/Bv5T4-L4gfU<b><span class="red">?si=1MdmEOw****I1fX-</span></b></span></p><p>A URL point­ing to a case on CanLII may share de­tails of the search that you used:</p><p><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/2023/2023qccs1167/2023qccs1167.html?resultId=83ef81272f16479b9e9ae36de88447c9&amp;searchId=2024-09-15T20:49:40:016/f484cd9df4cf466593e6a022129a8ac9&amp;searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAVVVJMIHByaXZhY3kgcHJpdmlsZWdlAAAAAAE">https://www.can­lii.org/en/qc/qccs/doc/2023/2023qccs1167/2023qccs1167.html<b><span class="red">?re­sul­tId=83ef81272f16479b9e9ae36de88447c9&amp;searchId=2024-09-15T20:49:40:016/f484cd9df4cf466593e6a022129a8ac9&amp;searchUrl­Hash=AAAAAQAVVVJMIHByaXZhY3kgcHJpdml­sZWd­lAAAAAAE</span></b></a></p><p>Clicking on the above link doesn’t just take you to 2023 QCCS 1167. It also will re­veal that I had got there by search­ing for the terms “URL,” “pri­va­cy,” and “priv­i­lege.”</p><p>A rel­a­tive­ly new brows­er func­tion that re­lies on in­for­ma­tion in a URL is called a “<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments">text frag­ment</a>.” A text frag­ment in a URL will look like this:</p><p><span class="code">#:~:text=[…]</span></p><p>When a text frag­ment is in a URL, mod­ern browsers will au­to­mat­i­cal­ly scroll to and high­light the specified con­tent at the des­ti­na­tion page.</p><p>For ex­am­ple, if you click on <a href="#:~:text=many%20modern%20browsers,highlighted">this link</a>, many mod­ern browsers (not Firefox, yet) will take you to back to this page, but with a specified piece of text high­light­ed. Google’s search re­sults will some­times link to a page us­ing a text frag­ment to high­light ma­te­r­i­al as­so­ci­at­ed with the search that brought you there. The risk is that if you share that URL, it may re­veal in­for­ma­tion about your search. Footnote 1 in <em>R. v. Dick</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/k5wv0">2024 BCCA 272</a> in­cludes a URL with a text frag­ment. In that case, the high­light­ed text frag­ment ac­tu­al­ly seems apt to the pur­pose of the ci­ta­tion.</p><p>I have also seen peo­ple ac­ci­den­tal­ly link to a URL that points to a lo­ca­tion on the com­put­er they hap­pened to be work­ing on at the time, in­stead of to a lo­ca­tion on the Internet. This can po­ten­tial­ly even re­veal in­for­ma­tion pro­tect­ed by so­lic­i­tor–client priv­i­lege or re­veal that a ghost­writer was used. E.g. some­thing like:</p><p><span class="code">C:\MYFILES\mé­moires\[NAME OF COUNSEL]\[NAME OF CLIENT]\...</span></p><p>The above ex­am­ples are to show the ways you might ac­ci­den­tal­ly share more in­for­ma­tion than you in­tend to share when you link us­ing a URL: track­ing IDs, ex­plic­it search query in­for­ma­tion, or hints about how you got to the page, and more.</p><h3 hyphens="none">Keeping your URLs clean</h3><p>Here are some best prac­tices to keep your URLs clean, and to avoid leak­ing in­for­ma­tion you’d rather not share:</p><ul><li>When us­ing CanLII, avoid copy­ing a URL from your brows­er’s ad­dress bar.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><span><label for="fn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1-expand" class="margin-expand"/><label for="fn-1-expand" class="sidenote" hyphens="none">Certainly, there is a way to copy from the address bar safely (i.e. copy only as far as the <span class="code">.html</span>). But if as a rule you don’t copy from the address bar, you will not risk copying too much information.</label></span></span> Instead, copy the URL in the CanLII ci­ta­tion (e.g. <span class="code">&lt;https://can­lii.ca/t/jwp64&gt;</span>) or from the di­rect links in the drop­down menu at­tached to each para­graph.</li><li>Examine the URL to see if there is con­tent that comes af­ter a ques­tion mark <span class="code">?</span>. Often this con­tent is un­nec­es­sary. Strip it away and see if the URL works as in­tend­ed. If it works fine, go ahead and use the sim­pler URL.</li><li>Unless you’re in­ten­tion­al­ly us­ing the <em>text frag­ment</em> fea­ture, delete any con­tent in a URL fol­low­ing <span class="code">#:~:text=</span></li></ul><div class="endnotes print-only"><p><h2 hyphens="none">Notes</h2></p><p class="footnote" id="fn-1">1. <a href="#fn-source-1" class="backlink undecorated"> ↑ </a>Certainly, there is a way to copy from the ad­dress bar safe­ly (i.e. copy only as far as the <span class="code">.html</span>). But if as a rule you don’t copy from the ad­dress bar, you will not risk copy­ing too much in­for­ma­tion.</p></div></root>
