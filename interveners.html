Together, they ac­count­ed for 25% of all in­ter­ven­tions from 2010–2016. This is a no­tice­able de­crease com­pared to the num­bers from 10 and 20 years ago.

Most of the case­load at the Supreme Court of Canada con­sists of dis­cre­tionary ap­peals: the ap­pel­lant re­quests that their ap­peal be heard, and the court de­cides whether they will hear the case. But, about 20–25% of the case­load at the Supreme Court of Canada con­sists of ap­peals that are heard “as of right”—au­to­mat­i­cal­ly. As-of-right ap­peals gen­er­al­ly in­volve in­dictable crim­i­nal offenses where one of the judges at the low­er court dis­agreed with their court’s de­ci­sion.<span><label for="152297860" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="152297860" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em><a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/FullText.html">Criminal Code</a></em>, RSC&nbsp;1985, ss.&nbsp;691-693.</span></span> In 2016, only two of the four­teen ap­peals in that cat­e­go­ry at­tract­ed any in­ter­ven­ers.</p><p><img src="assets/interventions_discretionary_v_as-of-right.png"/></p><p>I can think of two rea­sons why these cas­es are get­ting less help from in­ter­ven­ers.</p><p>For a case to make it onto the court’s dis­cre­tionary dock­et, it must pass through a filter. The court se­lects cas­es that in­volve “a ques­tion of pub­lic im­por­tance or […] an im­por­tant is­sue of law”. As-of-right ap­peals side­step this filter. This could lead to these cas­es just not be­ing as in­ter­est­ing to out­side par­ties.</p><p>Another ex­pla­na­tion could be that the ap­pel­lants in these cas­es (of­ten, crim­i­nal de­fen­dants) don’t have the same abil­i­ty to wran­gle out­side help for their po­si­tion.</p><hr/><p>The Supreme Court of Canada is get­ting more in­put from third par­ty in­ter­ven­ers than ever be­fore. This is po­ten­tial­ly a good thing, but that de­pends on which the­o­ry re­gard­ing the role of in­ter­ven­ers is true.<span><label for="1068237613" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1068237613" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">There are var­i­ous the­o­ries re­gard­ing the na­ture of am­i­ci in the U.S.: in­ter­est-group lob­by­ists, gen­uine friends of the court or of the par­ties, or a group of Supreme Court ex­perts who have learned what in­for­ma­tion the jus­tices crave and who are part of a man­aged strat­e­gy by the par­ties to win their cas­es. Interveners in Canada have been de­scribed as: gen­uine friends of the court who are try­ing to help the court make more ac­cu­rate de­ci­sions, in­ter­est-groups pre­sent­ing the best par­ti­san ar­gu­ments with which the jus­tices can align, or in­ter­est­ed third par­ties that the court lis­tens to in or­der to in­crease the le­git­i­ma­cy of its de­ci­sions.</span></span></p><p>The “Amicus Machine” in the U.S. was built over a pe­ri­od of about 15-20 years, large­ly undi­rect­ed, and not nec­es­sar­i­ly best de­signed to fill its os­ten­si­ble role.<span><label for="3663537905" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3663537905" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">This idea was dis­cussed in a spe­cial episode of the <em>First Mondays</em> pod­cast, <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/amici-7-one-big-13254791">Amici #7: One Big Superbrief</a></em>.</span></span></p><p>As in­ter­ven­tions be­come more fre­quent at the Supreme Court of Canada, we (or rather, the jus­tices) have the op­por­tu­ni­ty to di­rect how this prac­tice grows.
