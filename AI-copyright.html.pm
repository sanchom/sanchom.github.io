My article, "Copyright Throughout a Creative AI
Pipeline,"◊note-cite["McCann"] was just published by the Canadian
Journal of Law & Technology. The final, reviewed and edited version is
only accessible through ◊a[#:href
"https://nextcanada.westlaw.com/Document/I17a8222eea2711ebbea4f0dc9fb69570/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)&VR=3.0&RS=cblt1.0)"]{WestLaw}
for the first nine months after publication. But I am allowed to share
[this draft version on
SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3893972) for
the time being.

This draft version does not include some of the acknowledgements and
important references that made it into the final version, so I include
those below.

I would like to thank Professor Jon Festinger, Q.C., for many helpful
discussions while supervising this work and Professor Graham Reynolds

the final piece that are not included in the draft version that I've
shared above. These were enlightening and make related arguments to
mine, so I would like to share them here as well.
