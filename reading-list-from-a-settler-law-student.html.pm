In this reading list, I've included much that I've read (or listened
to, or watched) that has helped develop my understanding of
colonialism and its effects on Indigenous people in Canada, as well as
visions for the future. I have also just generally included
perspectives from Indigenous people that have influenced my thinking
today.◊note{I'm maintaining this page in response to the [Calls for
Justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous
Women and Girls](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/), specifically Call for
Justice 6.1: "We call upon all media, news corporations and outlets,
and, in particular, ◊ellipsis bloggers ◊ellipsis, to take decolonizing
approaches to their work and publications in order to educate all
Canadians about Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people" and to
"[s]upport Indigenous people sharing their stories, from their
perspectives ◊ellipsis"} I'll keep this updated.
